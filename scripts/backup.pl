# backup.pl -- CLI entry point for the backup driver (blueprint backup-driver,
# package 01-driver-skeleton).
#
# This file owns ONLY: argument parsing, dispatch, JSON encoding, printing,
# and the process exit code. All engine mechanics -- the state machine, the
# run-state file, the resume-token grammar, phase discovery, and the
# decision-kind enum -- live in scripts/backup/Run.pm (package Backup::Run).
# Backup::Run::execute() PRINTS NOTHING and never calls exit: it returns
# ($exit_code, $result_href), and this script is the only place that turns
# that into stdout / stderr / a real process exit. See the spec
# (01-driver-skeleton-spec.md) S2.7 for why the seam is drawn there.
#
# USAGE
#   perl backup.pl run [--json] [--restart]
#   perl backup.pl run [--json] --resume <token> --answer <id>=<choice> [--answer <id>=<choice> ...]
#   perl backup.pl --help
#
# Exactly one JSON object (JSON::PP->new->canonical, newline-terminated) is
# written to stdout per invocation -- nothing else is ever written there. A
# refusal or error additionally writes a short human line to stderr, prefixed
# "backup:".
#
# Decision-kind string literals (the values of @Backup::Run::DECISION_KINDS)
# are defined in exactly ONE place: Run.pm's declaration. This file must
# never repeat one -- AC3 greps this file for every kind value and asserts
# absence.
#
# This package performs NO git operation of any kind (blueprint Decisions 4
# and 6, honoured by omission) and therefore never sets
# MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL -- see Run.pm's header for why a later phase module
# must not inherit that decision from here.

       backup.pl run [--json] --resume <token> --answer <id>=<choice> [--answer <id>=<choice> ...]
       backup.pl --help

  run                     execute (or continue) a backup run
    --json                  accepted for the wrapper's calling convention; output is always JSON, with or without this flag
    --restart               discard any existing run state and start a fresh run (also the escape hatch past a corrupt state file)
    --resume <token>         continue a paused run using the given resume token (mutually exclusive with --restart)
    --answer <id>=<choice>  answer one pending decision; repeat once per pending decision

  --help                  print this usage text and exit 0 (touches no state)

Exactly one JSON object is written to stdout per invocation.

Exit codes: 0 complete, 10 needs a decision, 20 complete with failures, 2 usage, 3 resume token refused, 4 answer refused, 1 internal error.
