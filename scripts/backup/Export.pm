# Export.pm -- backup driver phase 03-export-and-push (blueprint
# backup-driver).
#
# Absorbs today's SKILL.md Steps 2 (detect differences), 3 (handle each
# file + settings merge), 3.5 (container settings sync), 4 (sensitive-data
# scan) and 5 (commit and push). See the spec for the full contract:
#   .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/backup-driver/specs/03-export-and-push-spec.md
# including its BINDING coordinator rulings (S8, P10-P12), which supersede
# anything earlier in that document that conflicts.
#
# THIS MODULE WRAPS EXISTING SCRIPTS. It reimplements none of their logic --
# no JSON diffing, no preference matching, no merge algorithm, no secret
# scanning. Its job is ordering, exit-code interpretation, turning
# genuinely-undecided things into decision records, applying answered
# choices, checkpointing so an interrupted run does not redo finished work,
# and making a mid-push death safe.
#
# THE REPOSITORY EVERY GIT OPERATION TARGETS is <home>/.claude/ccpraxis (the
# live install / export repo) -- never the dev clone. Decision 4 forbids
# this module from touching the clone/live relationship at all.
#
# Decision 4 + ruling R6 (01-driver-skeleton-spec.md S8): the push NEVER
# happens without an explicitly answered push_confirmation, and R6 wipes a
# phase's stored answers/items on re-entry after a "running" (mid-execution
# kill) prior status -- so consent can never be silently replayed. Because
# R6 wipes checkpoints too, this module never trusts its own state to know
# whether a push already happened after a crash; it asks GIT: a clean
# worktree with 0 unpushed commits means the push already completed (no
# second push, no decision asked); N > 0 unpushed means it died between
# commit and push (ask again); a dirty worktree means it died before the
# commit (ask again with the full pending set). See _do_commit_review /
# _do_push_confirmation_and_push.
#
# Ruling P10 (spec S8): sync-export.pl's real emitted status set is
# {export_only, identical, linked, live_only, missing, not_linked,
# settings_changed, tracked} -- NOT the SKILL.md-documented set (which
# includes three statuses -- conflict, container_settings_diverged,
# marketplace_changed -- that are never actually emitted). This module
# branches on the REAL set; an unrecognised status is a reported unit
# failure, never silently ignored. file_conflict decisions are driven by
# not_linked (a live regular file that differs from the repo copy) rather
# than the never-emitted 'conflict' (handled generically too, in case a
# future sync-export.pl version emits it).
#
# Ruling P11: the skip-keys handoff from package 02 is read via
# $ctx->{get_phase_item}->('preflight', 'settings_outcome') -- never by
# parsing the run-state file directly (Decision 10). Three defensive cases
# (the accessor missing from $ctx, returning undef, or returning a
# malformed skip_keys) all fail closed: the merge is not run, and the unit
# degrades rather than silently passing zero skip-keys (SKILL.md:209 -- a
# silently-empty skip-key list would push an only_left key into the repo,
# or overwrite a diverged one with the live value).
#
# Ruling P12 records that Step 3's "Merge" choice is deliberately narrowed:
# a deterministic driver cannot fabricate a merged file, so the third
# choice becomes merge_manually -- the driver writes nothing and reports
# both paths for a human to reconcile. See reports/parity/03-export-and-push.md.
#
# Decision 10: the decision-kind enum is CLOSED. This module emits exactly
# four kinds: file_conflict, container_settings_key, sensitive_finding,
# push_confirmation.
#
# Decision 7 barriers, enforced in code (not prose):
#   B1 -- the container diff (U5/U6) does not run unless settings_merge
#         (U4) checkpointed (on either its success path or its
#         nothing-to-merge path). A failed U4 leaves the key unset, so U5/U6
#         are skipped this pass.
#   B2 -- no git verb of any kind is spawned until sensitive_scan (U7)
#         checkpoints clean. U8/U9 are both gated on is_done('sensitive_scan').
#   B3 -- sensitive_finding is never batched with anything else (returned
#         alone, immediately); push_confirmation is likewise always the
#         sole decision in its needs_decision return.
#
# This module must never depend on package 01's engine module or its
# sibling (spec S2.0): everything this
# module needs arrives through $ctx, so `perl -c` is clean standalone and a
# test can copy this single file into a scratch BACKUP_PHASE_DIR. The small
# helpers below duplicated from Preflight.pm (_native_path, _run_capture,
# _run_with_stdin, _read_or_init_json_file, _assign_nested, _write_json_file,
# _clamp, _mint_ids, _title_key) are duplicated DELIBERATELY -- Decision 9
# makes the write sets disjoint, and a shared helper module is not in
# anyone's write set.
#
# The four blockers package 02 shipped with, and how this module avoids
# each (full detail: spec S2.10):
#   1. Latin-1 JSON corruption -- every JSON file THIS module writes
#      (container settings.json) goes through _write_json_file, which
#      encodes with ->utf8->canonical->pretty and prints to a binmode
#      handle, then File::Temp + rename in the destination directory.
#   2. Absent vs unreadable vs unparseable -- _read_or_init_json_file
#      distinguishes them; only "absent" may seed an empty structure. A
#      write is refused (the unit degrades) on any read error, so a
#      malformed container settings.json is never overwritten.
#   3. Dotted keys -- json-diff.pl/filter-diff.pl emit parent.child keys;
#      writes use _assign_nested (nest on first '.'), deletes use the
#      mirror-image _delete_nested (remove only the leaf, never the whole
#      parent object).
#   4. die on an environmental condition -- nothing in this module dies on
#      a spawn failure, a read failure or a write failure; every such path
#      returns { failed => $msg } and the run_phase loop degrades that one
#      unit rather than aborting the whole run. die is reserved for a
#      programming error ($ctx misuse), which package 01 turns into
#      phase_died correctly.
