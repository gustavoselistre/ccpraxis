# Vault.pm -- backup driver phase 04-vault-and-todos (blueprint
# backup-driver). The legacy todo step this module once ran was retired
# outright by blueprint almanac-records package 13 (Decision 14): this
# module now sequences vault-sync.pl only.
#
# Absorbs SKILL.md Step 5.5 (sync each registered vault project, sub-steps
# 5.5.a/b/c); Step 5.4, the legacy todo step, was retired by almanac-records
# 13. See the spec for the full contract:
#   .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/backup-driver/specs/04-vault-and-todos-spec.md
# including its BINDING coordinator rulings (S0.1, S0.2, S2.9), which
# supersede anything earlier in that document that conflicts.
#
# THIS MODULE WRAPS EXISTING SCRIPTS. It never runs git against the vault,
# never copies a file into the vault, never computes a hash, and never
# re-implements a merge. `vault-sync.pl` keeps owning every git operation,
# every hash, every merge, every file move. This module only sequences its
# invocations, interprets exit codes, turns a genuine conflict into a
# decision record, and checkpoints per-project progress.
#
# S0.1 (coordinator ruling P14) -- the d667 premise, corrected: bug report
# .ccpraxis-local-data/bug-reports/20260901-025445-d667.md documents a real
# incident where a fresh registration's ops journal decoded a path through
# `Andr\xE9` with a bare `JSON::PP->new->decode` (utf8-FLAGGED, not
# transcoded), so every push rolled back while `commit-and-push` reported
# success, and the next sync then staged `delete_local` for every file.
# `rolled_back_nothing_stored` is therefore a FAILURE for that project,
# never folded into success -- not because the cause is unknown, but because
# it is the documented signature of a utf8-flag-vs-bytes handoff defect that
# has now shipped three times in this initiative (package 02's whole-file
# corruption, package 03's nested double-encoding, d667's journal), every
# time under a green suite. `sensitive_blocked` and
# `sensitive_blocked_post_rename` are reported under their OWN status
# strings -- they are blocks, not rollbacks: nothing was stored and the
# vault was never touched (or was restored from HEAD), and conflating them
# with a rollback would tell the operator to do the wrong thing.
#
# Decision 5's motivating incident: a vault sync killed at 90 minutes lost
# all of its progress. This module checkpoints per PROJECT (not per whole
# phase), and declares `crash_preserves_items` on its phase_spec (package 01
# p16 contract amendment) so a mid-execution death does not erase completed
# projects' checkpoints. The safety condition that flag imposes: a
# consequential success (`committed_and_pushed`) is never trusted from the
# child's own report alone -- S2.7's `list-projects` re-check (this
# module's analogue of Export.pm's `ls-remote`) confirms it against the
# vault's own record before recording success, because on Windows a signal
# death behind a wrapper is invisible to `$?`.
#
# S2.9 (BINDING ruling V1) -- what R6 actually clears: `Run.pm` wipes BOTH
# a phase's answers AND its items/scratch on a "running" (mid-execution
# kill) re-entry, unless the phase opts into `crash_preserves_items` (which
# only rescues items/scratch -- answers are ALWAYS cleared, unconditionally,
# so a stale "yes" is never silently replayed). Consequence for this module:
# after a hard kill, a project whose `session.<tok>` survived is trusted
# (no `sync-project` respawn, no fresh session minted) but any of its
# conflicts that were pending an answer are RE-ASKED under the SAME
# decision id (a pure function of tok+path), because the answer that was
# given is gone. This is the CRASH1/CRASH2 behaviour the oracle exercises.
#
# MINOR 12 (red-team step 6) -- the honest limit of that trust: a preserved
# `session.<tok>` has no freshness bound. A resume days later replays a
# `session_id` whose journal may since have been cleared server-side
# (`vault-sync.pl`'s H2 defence then reads as a false `commit_failed`), and
# a crash landing between a genuinely successful `commit-and-push` and this
# module's own terminal checkpoint re-runs `commit-and-push` with an
# already-consumed session id -- reporting a pushed project as failed.
# Neither is destructive (no data loss, no silently-replayed consent), but
# it is worth stating plainly because it narrows the safety argument S2.9's
# spec text makes ("absence of session.<tok> is how a half-resolved project
# is detected") -- here the session SURVIVES and IS reused, unbounded.
#
# This module must never depend on package 01's engine module or its
# siblings Preflight.pm/Export.pm/Closeout.pm (spec S1.1): everything it
# needs arrives through $ctx, so `perl -c` is clean standalone and a test
# can copy this single file into a scratch BACKUP_PHASE_DIR. The helpers
# below (_run_capture, _sanitize_utf8, _widen_utf8, _ensure_utf8_bytes,
# _clamp, _clamp_text, _mint_ids, _title_key, _read_file_raw) are
# duplicated from Export.pm DELIBERATELY -- Decision 9 makes the write sets
# disjoint, and a shared helper module is nobody's to create.
#
# The four earlier blockers, and how this module avoids each (spec S2.10):
#   1. Latin-1 JSON corruption -- this module writes no JSON file at all;
#      the only writer of the run-state file is Run.pm. Everything handed
#      to $ctx goes through _sanitize_utf8 first (raw UTF-8 bytes), because
#      backup.pl's stdout encoder (JSON::PP->new->canonical->encode) has no
#      ->utf8 and cannot carry anything else without corrupting it.
#   2. Absent vs unreadable vs unparseable collapsed into one undef --
#      _interpret_response keeps "did not spawn", "spawned, non-zero exit"
#      and "spawned, exit 0, unparseable" as three distinct outcomes (S1.7);
#      none of the three is ever read as "empty".
#   3. `$? >> 8` reporting a signal-killed child as exit 0 -- _run_capture
#      copies Export.pm's reap form verbatim: `(st & 127) ? 128+(st&127) :
#      st>>8`. AC21 proves a signal-killed vault-sync.pl is not exit 0.
#   4. `die` on an environmental condition -- no environmental path here
#      dies; a missing HOME/root/vault, an unspawnable child or an
#      unparseable response each returns/records a `failed` unit or a
#      degraded project, never an exception. `die` would only ever fire on
#      an invalid decision record we constructed ourselves (a programming
#      error), via $ctx->{decision}'s own validation.
#
# The fifth, specific to this package -- non-ASCII must survive in
# FILENAMES, not just content (P15, ruling in spec S0.2): every string this
# module hands to $ctx (checkpoint/note/decision) is passed through
# _sanitize_utf8 (narrow, raw UTF-8 bytes); every string pulled back OUT of
# $ctx (get_item, answers) and about to become a child's ARGV is passed
# through _widen_utf8 first. Skipping the widen step on the way back out is
# exactly d667's Defect B, one process boundary over: Run.pm's own read
# (JSON::PP->new->decode, no ->utf8) sets the utf8 flag on every decoded
# string WITHOUT transcoding, so a non-ASCII path or slug would reach a
# child's argv double-encoded and simply not exist on disk.
