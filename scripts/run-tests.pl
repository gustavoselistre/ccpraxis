#!/usr/bin/env perl
# run-tests.pl -- the repo-wide test runner. Parallel where that is safe,
# serial where it is not.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A full sweep was ~70 minutes of CPU across 243 files, run
# one at a time, and a suite nobody wants to run is a suite that stops getting
# run. Measured on this host: 4190s of CPU, 915s wall at six-way parallelism.
# The work is dominated by PROCESS CREATION -- a bare statusline spawn costs
# ~292ms here -- not by CPU, so parallelism buys more than the core count
# suggests.
#
# `prove` is not an option: the Git-for-Windows perl ships no TAP::Harness
# (see the repo CLAUDE.md). This runs each .t as its own process and judges it
# by exit code plus `not ok` count, which is the same rule the project already
# applies by hand.
#
# CONTAINER TESTS RUN SERIALLY, and that is not a limitation to remove later.
# They start real podman containers against ONE podman machine, so running them
# concurrently makes them contend for the same resource -- slower in wall-clock
# AND flakier, which is the documented failure signature of this suite
# (EXIT=124/255 with no failing assertion). They are detected by what they
# import rather than by a tag, so a new one is classified correctly without
# anybody remembering to mark it.
#
# ROUTING BY MARKER (blueprint test-platform-split, package 06-route-by-marker).
# classify_file() below is the sole routing predicate: marker gate first (an
# illegal/absent marker is refused, package 03), then the pre-existing serial
# heuristic (still wins -- ten of the fifteen podman-starting tests are marked
# `any`, and routing those into ANOTHER container would be podman-in-podman),
# then the declared marker value. A file classify_file routes to 'container'
# only actually reaches the container lane (scripts/run-tests-container.pl,
# package 05, required into its own namespace below) when the
# CCPRAXIS_CONTAINER_LANE_ENABLED env var is set truthy -- an explicit,
# lane-AVAILABILITY opt-in, off by default, never a routing switch: with it
# off, every file classify_file would have routed to 'container' simply runs
# on the host instead, exactly as it did before this package existed. This is
# deliberately NOT a new CLI flag (out of scope per the package spec) -- see
# run_sweep()'s own comment at the gate for the full rationale.
#
# Usage:
#   perl scripts/run-tests.pl                    # everything
#   perl scripts/run-tests.pl --fast             # skip the container tests
#   perl scripts/run-tests.pl --jobs 8           # override parallelism
#   perl scripts/run-tests.pl --nice             # low-impact: cap workers, see below
#   perl scripts/run-tests.pl plugins/sandbox    # limit to a plugin or a glob
#   perl scripts/run-tests.pl --state=failed     # re-run only last run's red files
#
# --nice / CCPRAXIS_TEST_JOBS -- a low-impact mode, added because the default
# below (cores-2) is a throughput-maximising choice that is wrong for the
# common case of an agent kicking off a sweep while the operator is still
# using the machine. Named "--nice" after the Unix tool it rhymes with in
# INTENT (be a considerate background citizen) -- it does NOT touch OS
# scheduling priority the way `nice(1)` does; that would need to cover every
# spawned git/podman child too, which is a separate, larger change.
#
# --nice caps parallelism at max(2, cores/4): a quarter of the machine,
# floored at 2 rather than letting it round down to 1 on a 4-core host --
# 1 worker turns a sweep serial and "unbearably long" rather than merely
# slower. On this repo's reference 8-core host that is 2 workers, the same
# total CPU-seconds spread over roughly four times the wall-clock, leaving
# the operator three quarters of the machine.
#
# CCPRAXIS_TEST_JOBS=N is the same idea as an ambient default: set once in an
# agent's environment so every sweep it kicks off is gentle without having to
# remember a flag per invocation.
#
# Precedence (most to least specific): explicit `--jobs N` > `--nice` >
# `CCPRAXIS_TEST_JOBS` env var > the plain cores-2 default. The plain default
# is UNCHANGED -- this adds a choice, it does not remove the fast path for
# someone who is actively waiting on the result.
#
# --fast's meaning is UNCHANGED by the routing above: it skips tests that
# start real containers (a property of a file's own content, the serial
# heuristic), never the container LANE (an execution-environment choice,
# orthogonal to that contract). --fast still empties only the host-serial
# set; it never touches the container set.

Membership is a TEXT MATCH on a file's own source, NOT an answer to "does this start a real container" -- a file that merely mentions the container helpers is skipped too (report 20260918-042312-02db).

This does NOT touch the container LANE below -- if that is enabled, its files still run there regardless of --fast.
  --jobs N        parallelism for non-container tests (default: cores - 2)
  --nice          low-impact mode: cap parallelism at max(2, cores/4), leaving the machine usable for whoever else is on it. Does not touch OS scheduling priority (spawned git/podman children aren't covered by that). Env var CCPRAXIS_TEST_JOBS=N sets the same kind of ambient low-impact default without a per-run flag.
  --state=failed  re-run only the files recorded failing by the previous run
  --keep-sandbox  do not remove each file's per-file sandbox HOME after it runs (package 21-test-sandbox). Default: removed.

Precedence for parallelism (most to least specific):
