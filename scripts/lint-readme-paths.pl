# lint-readme-paths.pl — verify every backtick-quoted path in README.md
# that *unambiguously refers to a ccpraxis file* resolves to a file or
# directory that actually exists on disk.
#
# The heuristic is intentionally narrow — we only lint backticks that
# clearly point at the ccpraxis tree (or a known live-install location
# like `~/.claude/...`), and skip everything else (conceptual paths
# like `.claude/skills/` that describe a per-project layout, command
# fragments, slash commands, env vars, etc.). False positives waste
# the user's attention; false negatives just mean a stale path slips
# the lint and is caught by the human reviewer. We err toward the latter.
#
# Catches drift like "you renamed scripts/sandbox-launcher.pl to
# plugins/sandbox/scripts/launcher.pl but the README still mentions
# the old name." Run from /backup as a pre-flight, or manually.
#
# Usage: perl lint-readme-paths.pl [README.md]
#
# Defaults to <repo-root>/README.md.
#
# What gets linted (any of these matched at start of the backtick):
#   1. `~/.claude/...`           — absolute live install path
#   2. `<top-level-subdir>/...`  — relative to repo root, where top-level
#                                  subdir is one of:
#                                    scripts/, plugins/, skills/,
#                                    global-config/, container-config/,
#                                    references/, .claude-plans/
#
# Additional skip rules (a candidate matching the above is still skipped):
#   - contains '<' or '>' (placeholder)
#   - contains whitespace
#   - contains shell metacharacters: $ [ ] ( ) | & ; * ?
#
# Path resolution:
#   - `~/...`     → relative to $HOME
#   - everything else → relative to <repo-root>
#
# Exit codes: 0 = all paths resolve, 1 = one or more missing, 2 = error
