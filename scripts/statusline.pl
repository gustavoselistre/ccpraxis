# ── Elision, and the non-ambiguity guarantee ─────────────────
# THE ELISION MARKER IS NON-NEGOTIABLE. A shortened field that dropped its
# '>' / '<' would be presented to the reader as if it were whole -- exactly
# the ambiguity criterion 4 exists to forbid. So no path through either
# primitive below returns a bare fragment of the text:
#
#   * $max < 1              -> '' (the field does not render at all);
#   * the text fits         -> the text, verbatim, with no marker;
#   * $max < 2              -> the BARE MARKER. Nothing else can be shown in
#                              one column, and the fit ladder's bottom rungs
#                              ask for exactly this;
#   * $max >= 2 but not one
#     whole character fits
#     beside the marker     -> marker PLUS one whole character anyway.
#
# That last case is a deliberate, BOUNDED overrun of $max (at most three
# columns, the excess of one 4-byte character) and it is safe because $max is
# a FIELD budget, not the row's: the ladder re-measures the whole row after
# every rung and answers an overrun with the next rung. The alternative --
# a bare marker while the project field is still on the row -- would discard
# the very text the field exists to carry and would break §2.4.4's N1/N2,
# which require a NON-EMPTY prefix/suffix beside the marker.
