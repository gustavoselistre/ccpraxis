# reap-orphans.pl — find (and optionally kill) processes left behind by a
# Claude Code session that has ended.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Bug report 20260828-095201-7c1e: a perl.exe running a
# throwaway probe out of a session scratchpad was found alive NINE DAYS AND
# NINETEEN HOURS after the session that spawned it had exited. Its parent was
# gone. It had burnt 0.016s of CPU in total -- blocked on a read, not spinning --
# while holding 11 MB and 135 handles. Nothing in ccpraxis recorded that the
# session had spawned it, killed it when the session ended, or swept for it
# afterwards. It was found by accident, in a process list, while investigating
# something else.
#
# That report's own words: "This is silent and unbounded. One leak is 11 MB; the
# failure mode is that every hung probe across every session accumulates until
# someone happens to look at a process list."
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS AN ORPHAN HERE -- three conditions, ALL required:
#
#   1. its command line names a session scratchpad
#      (<temp>/claude/<project>/<session-uuid>/scratchpad/...)
#   2. its parent process no longer exists
#   3. it is older than --min-age-seconds (default 1h)
#
# Condition 2 is the one doing the real work and is why this is safe: a live
# session's children have a live parent. A process whose parent is gone was
# reparented, which on both Windows and POSIX means the thing that started it is
# not around to stop it. Condition 3 exists only so a process caught in the
# split second between its parent exiting and its own cleanup is not killed.
#
# NEVER KILLS THE CURRENT SESSION. --session-id excludes a uuid outright, and
# the running process and its own ancestors are excluded by pid. A reaper that
# can kill the session invoking it is worse than the leak.
#
# DEFAULT IS REPORT-ONLY. Killing requires --kill, explicitly. This is a tool
# that terminates processes; it does not get to do that as a side effect of
# someone running it to look around.
#
#   perl scripts/reap-orphans.pl                        # report candidates
#   perl scripts/reap-orphans.pl --kill                 # report and terminate
#   perl scripts/reap-orphans.pl --min-age-seconds 300  # loosen the age floor
#   perl scripts/reap-orphans.pl --json                 # machine-readable
#
# SCRATCHPAD DIRECTORIES ARE DELIBERATELY NOT SWEPT, and the report asked for
# that to be an explicit decision rather than an accident. They are kept:
#   - they are the post-mortem. This very bug was diagnosed by reading probe4.pl
#     out of a scratchpad belonging to a session that had ended nine days
#     earlier; a sweeper would have deleted the evidence.
#   - they are small and inert. A leaked directory costs disk; a leaked PROCESS
#     costs memory, handles, and a share of whatever it is blocked on.
#   - the harness owns that directory, not ccpraxis. Deleting another tool's
#     working directory on a schedule is how you lose something that mattered.
# If they ever do need bounding, bound them by age with the same report-first
# discipline as the process path -- do not fold it into this script's --kill.
# SHAPE: a pure selection library plus a thin CLI, the convention this repo
# already uses (bp-dispatch-log.pl). The point is testability
# WITHOUT SPAWNING ANYTHING: select_orphans takes a process list as data, so the
# oracle feeds it synthetic processes instead of creating real orphans and real
# kills inside the suite. A test for a process reaper that reaps is a test that
# can take out something it did not mean to.

# terminate_pid($pid) -- send the kill IN THE NAMESPACE THE PID CAME FROM.
#
# THE BUG THIS REPLACES (20260917-033101-c455). This block used to try
# `kill('TERM', $pid)` first, fall back to `taskkill` when that failed, and then
# verify with `kill(0, $pid)`. Every one of those perl calls asks MSYS about a
# pid that `enumerate_windows` collected from `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process`.
#
# Git-for-Windows perl runs under MSYS2, which keeps its OWN pid numbering.
# `ps -W` prints both and they are different numbers for the same process:
#
#     PID    PPID    WINPID   COMMAND
#  832282       1    159020   /usr/bin/perl        <- one process, two ids
#
# perl's $$, getppid() and kill() use PID. CIM, Get-Process, Stop-Process and
# taskkill use WINPID. Crossing them DOES NOT ERROR -- it answers "no such
# process", which reads as a real answer.
#
# So the old first attempt could never land (hence the taskkill workaround, whose
# comment recorded the symptom without the cause), and worse, the VERIFICATION
# `kill(0, $winpid)` returned false for every live process, setting $ok = 1
# unconditionally. THE TOOL REPORTED EVERY KILL AS SUCCESSFUL and @failed could
# not be populated. A reaper that cannot say what it failed to reap is exactly
# the tool you cannot trust when something leaks -- which is how it was found,
# after two launchers survived 37 hours on this host.
