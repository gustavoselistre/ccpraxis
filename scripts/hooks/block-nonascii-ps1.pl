# block-nonascii-ps1.pl — PreToolUse guard: refuse to write non-ASCII into a
# .ps1 file.
#
# WHY A HOOK AND NOT A RULE. This rule was already written down, in the
# user-global CLAUDE.md, in detail, with the failure mode spelled out. Both .ps1
# files in ccpraxis violated it anyway, and nobody noticed until 2026-08-29 --
# when a change to an unrelated comment happened to require opening them.
# claude-sandbox.ps1, the sandbox launcher itself, was carrying THREE 0x94
# bytes. Operator: "So just a rule wasn't enough, it should also be handled by
# hooks then."
#
# That is the same conclusion guard-git-mutations.sh reached after a prohibited
# `git stash` destroyed a completed fix-batch: a written instruction is not an
# enforcement mechanism. This is the .ps1 equivalent, and it sits beside
# block-nul-redirect.pl, which enforces the other Windows landmine the same way.
#
# THE FAILURE IT PREVENTS. The Write tool saves UTF-8 with no BOM. PowerShell
# 5.1 reads a BOM-less file as CP1252, so a multi-byte character decodes into
# stray bytes -- and an em dash (E2 80 94) contributes 0x94, which in CP1252 is
# a SMART QUOTE. PowerShell treats it as a string delimiter: it opens a phantom
# string, swallows the following braces, and reports `Missing closing '}'` at a
# line far from the real problem.
#
# An EVEN number of them happens to balance, which is why claude-sandbox.ps1
# kept working while being wrong. That is not a safety margin -- it means the
# next em dash anyone adds is the one that breaks the launcher, and the error
# will point somewhere else entirely.
#
# SCOPE: .ps1 only. .sh and .pl files are read by tools that handle UTF-8
# correctly; Git Bash is unaffected. Blocking non-ASCII everywhere would be a
# nuisance with no failure behind it.
#
# THE ESCAPE HATCH IS REAL: a file that genuinely needs non-ASCII may have one,
# provided it starts with a UTF-8 BOM, which is what makes PowerShell 5.1 decode
# it correctly. The guard checks for that first and stands aside.

BLOCKED: this write puts non-ASCII characters into a .ps1 file ($shown).

PowerShell 5.1 reads a BOM-less file as CP1252. An em dash (U+2014) becomes the bytes E2 80 94, and 0x94 is a SMART QUOTE in CP1252 -- PowerShell treats it as a string delimiter, opens a phantom string, swallows the following braces, and reports "Missing closing '}'" at a line far from the real problem.

Use ASCII: -- for an em dash, - for an en dash, -> for an arrow, plain quotes. If the file genuinely needs non-ASCII, give it a UTF-8 BOM first and this guard will stand aside.
