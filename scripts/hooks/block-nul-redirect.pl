# block-nul-redirect.pl — PreToolUse hook on Bash.
#
# Blocks commands that redirect to `NUL` (case-insensitive), which on Git Bash
# for Windows creates a literal file named `NUL` in the cwd instead of
# discarding output — the Windows NUL device only resolves from cmd.exe /
# PowerShell, not from Git Bash. The resulting stray file is hard to delete
# from Explorer and clutters every repo it lands in. Suggests `/dev/null` as
# the cross-shell-safe alternative.
#
# Wired in global-config/settings.json under hooks.PreToolUse with
# matcher "Bash", so it fires on every Bash tool call from any project.
#
# Spec (Claude Code PreToolUse hook):
#   stdin  — JSON: { tool_name, tool_input: { command, ... }, ... }
#   exit 0 — allow (default; nothing on stdout/stderr)
#   exit 2 — block; stderr is fed back to Claude as the deny reason
#   other  — non-blocking error (logged to the user)

# Match `> NUL`, `>NUL`, `>>NUL`, `2> NUL`, `2>NUL`, `&> NUL`, `&>NUL`, etc.
# Pattern: a `>` (with optional preceding `2`, `&`, or another `>`), then
# optional whitespace, then `NUL` as a word-boundary token. Case-insensitive
# because Windows treats NUL/nul/Nul as the same device.
#
# DELIBERATELY TEXT-ONLY, WITH NO QUOTE AWARENESS. It cannot tell a real
# redirect from the same characters appearing inside a search pattern or a
# string literal, so it also blocks `grep '>NUL' .` and a test fixture that
# quotes the shape. Those are false positives and they are real: three fired
# in one session on 2026-09-06, one of them while writing the regression test
# for the very bug this hook guards.
#
# The fix is NOT to make the regex quote-aware. That looks obvious and has a
# hole: `cmd 2>"NUL"` quotes the TARGET and still creates the file, so
# stripping quoted spans before matching would let a genuine redirect through.
# False negatives here cost an undeletable file; false positives cost a retry.
# The strictness stays.
#
# Instead there is an explicit escape hatch, below: the caller asserts, in
# words, that this particular command is a mention rather than a redirect. The
# assertion is deliberate, visible in the command itself, and logged.
# The optional ['"] is not cosmetic. `cmd 2>"NUL"` quotes the TARGET and still
# creates the file — quoting a redirect target changes nothing about the
# redirection — and without it this pattern let that form straight through.
# Found on 2026-09-07 by t/17 while pinning the shapes; the hook had shipped
# with the hole since it was written.
