name: backup
description: Syncs everything personal between the live host and your private repos — ccpraxis config (global + container) AND every project registered for vault backup (CLAUDE.md, skills, plans, memory). Scans for secrets before pushing. Resolves vault sync conflicts interactively. If you're in a project that has trackable Claude files but isn't registered for backup, offers to register it. Also surfaces Claude Code binary snapshots taken by /update and supports manual revert. Use when the user wants to sync config, back up settings, push config changes, sync vault projects, list/revert Claude Code snapshots, or says "backup", "sync config", "push config", "sync everything", "back up my work", "revert claude code", "list claude snapshots", "rollback claude".

This skill is a thin wrapper. Every mechanical step — git, file merges, the vault, the
secret scan, the report — is owned by a driver script. The wrapper's whole job is:
invoke the driver, present its decisions, relay its report, re-invoke with the answers.

## Modes

Two modes, chosen by intent:

1. **Full sync (default).** Intent like "backup", "sync config", "push config", "sync
   everything", "back up my work" — go to **Running the driver**.
2. **Snapshot/revert.** Intent like "revert claude code", "list snapshots", "rollback
   claude code", "restore claude code binary" — go directly to **Snapshot/revert mode**
   and never invoke the driver.

If intent is unclear, ask with `AskUserQuestion` before doing either.

## Running the driver

The full-sync path never touches git, files, or vault contents directly. Every call is
to `perl ~/.claude/ccpraxis/scripts/backup.pl` (the driver — lives at the ccpraxis repo
root, not `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`). The wrapper's loop is: invoke, branch on the exit
code, answer, re-invoke.

**First invocation** — no `--restart`, no `--resume`:

```
perl ~/.claude/ccpraxis/scripts/backup.pl run --json
```

Exactly one JSON object is written to stdout per invocation. On an error exit the driver
also writes one `backup: <message>` line to stderr — redirect stderr separately, or parse
the JSON line out and ignore that one; do not treat its presence as "stdout did not parse".
Stop and show the raw output verbatim only if no JSON object is present at all — never
guess an exit meaning from text.

| exit | status | what the wrapper does |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | complete | go to **Relaying the report**, then **Follow-up actions**, then stop. |
| 20 | complete_with_failures | go to **Relaying the report** (it surfaces the failures) and **Follow-up actions**, then stop — never report this as a clean backup. |
| 10 | needs_decision | go to **Presenting decisions** for every entry of `decisions[]`, collect one choice per decision, then re-invoke (see the resume form below) with `--resume <resume_token>` and one `--answer <id>=<choice-id>` per decision, all in the same call. Leaving any pending decision unanswered is refused (exit 4, `answer_missing`) — answer them together, never partially. |
| 2 | usage | a wrapper bug: stop, show `error.message`, change nothing. |
| 3 | token error | `token_missing` (no token held — a new session, or a crashed one): report that a paused run exists and ask the operator whether to `--restart` (discard it and start fresh) or stop — never restart silently, that drops pending decisions and re-runs completed phases. `token_malformed` / `token_unknown` / `token_replayed`: stop, show `error.message`, never retry the same token — `token_replayed` is terminal, that token is spent forever; offer `--restart` only as an explicit escape hatch taken on the operator's own word. |
| 4 | answer refused | the wrapper's own bug (`answer_unknown_id`, `answer_duplicate`, `answer_unknown_choice`, `answer_missing`). `consumed_seq` is written only after a successful resume, so on this path it is still unwritten and the resume token is still valid — that makes the run recoverable, but recovery means going back to **Presenting decisions** and asking the operator again for every pending decision, with the same token. `decisions[]` carries the choices that were OFFERED, never the operator's selections, so it cannot be replayed or re-derived into answers — never fabricate an answer from it. A second exit 4 after a genuine re-ask stops the loop and shows `error.message` verbatim. |
| 1 | internal | stop, surface `error.code` and `error.message`; never auto-restart — restarting repeats completed phases. |

**Resume invocation** (exit 10, one `--answer` per pending decision, all in the same call):

```
perl ~/.claude/ccpraxis/scripts/backup.pl run --json --resume <resume_token> --answer <id>=<choice-id> [--answer <id>=<choice-id> ...]
```

**Restart invocation** (exit 3 `token_missing`, only on the operator's own word — discards
the paused run):

```
perl ~/.claude/ccpraxis/scripts/backup.pl run --json --restart
```

**A `--resume` call that hangs or times out with no output.** Do not retry the same token:
the run may already have consumed it, and a replayed token is terminal (`token_replayed`).
Instead, re-invoke with no token at all, `perl ~/.claude/ccpraxis/scripts/backup.pl run --json`.
It reports the true state:
- **exit 3 `token_missing`**: the run is still paused, so the hung call never took effect and
  the original token is still valid. Retry the same `--resume` call with the same answers.
- **any other result**: the hung call had already consumed the token, and this call carries
  the run on from where it got to. Handle its exit as usual.

One case needs the operator first. If the hung call was answering the run's LAST decisions, it
may have finished the whole backup, and a token-less call on a finished run starts a fresh one.
Say so and ask before re-invoking.

Repeat the exit-10 branch until a terminal exit. Bound the loop at **20 driver
invocations**; if that bound is hit, stop, say plainly that the backup is **incomplete**
(never summarise it as done), and print the resume token so the operator can continue
this same run in a fresh session rather than restarting it and re-running completed
phases.

## Presenting decisions

The wrapper must never answer, select, or invent a choice on behalf of the operator —
every decision requires the operator's own selection via `AskUserQuestion`, obtained
fresh each time it is needed; synthesizing or guessing one, even from a prior answer
or from `decisions[]` itself, is not allowed. `decisions[]` is a record of the choices
OFFERED, not of anything the operator selected, so it can never stand in for consent.

Every entry of `decisions[]` follows the same shape: `title` is the question text,
`detail` and any `data` payload are shown to the operator BEFORE the question,
`choices[]` become the `AskUserQuestion` options labelled with each choice's `label`,
and the operator's selection is mapped back to that choice's `id` for
`--answer <id>=<choice-id>`. If a decision carries more choices than one
`AskUserQuestion` question can display, split it (narrow first, then choose) or fall
back to free-form text — never silently drop a choice, and never invent one.

For a `kind` not in the table below (a driver newer than this skill), fall back to
the generic presentation: show `title` + `detail` + `choices` verbatim and never
guess a default.

| kind | what it is | how to present it |
|---|---|---|
| dirty_worktree | ~/.claude/ccpraxis has uncommitted local changes before the remote integrate step | show the dirty file list from detail/data, offer `continue_without_merge` (leave the uncommitted changes untouched) or `merge_anyway` (git itself refuses if the merge would overwrite local changes) |
| remote_merge_conflict | merging origin/main hit a real conflict | show the conflicting paths from detail/data, offer `abort_merge` (abort and restore the pre-merge HEAD) or `keep_conflict` (leave the conflict on disk for manual resolution) |
| clone_live_divergence | the exported repo and the live tree disagree in a way preflight cannot reconcile automatically | show the divergence detail, offer `acknowledge` (continue anyway) or `treat_as_failure` (fail the run over it) |
| readme_drift | README.md or docs/repo-layout.md is stale relative to the tree on disk | show the drift detail (missing paths or a stale generated section), offer `acknowledge` (continue anyway) or `treat_as_failure` (fail the run over it) |
| settings_key | a live-vs-repo settings.json key differs, or exists on only one side | show the key and both values from detail/data, offer use-live, use-repo, keep-different-remember, or skip, noting that a remember choice is saved as a preference |
| marketplace_key | a live-vs-repo known_marketplaces.json entry differs | show the marketplace name and both sides, offer export/add, keep-remember, remove, or skip as fits the discrepancy |
| file_conflict | a synced file differs on both sides in a way that is not a settings key | show both versions (or a diff) from detail/data, offer use-live, use-export, or merge-manually |
| container_settings_key | a global-config-vs-container settings.json key differs | show the key and both values, offer propagate-to-container, keep-container, keep-different-remember, or skip |
| sensitive_finding | the pre-push secret scanner found a likely credential | show every finding (file, line, pattern) from detail/data verbatim, offer abort or rescan-after-fixing — never let the operator push past this decision silently |
| push_confirmation | ccpraxis is ready to commit and push a real change set | summarize what is being sent from detail/data (new and modified files), offer push-it or abort |
| vault_conflict | a vault-registered project has both local and vault changes to the same path since the last sync | show the conflict payload, including data.merge_preview when present (a diff3-style preview of both sides), offer use-local, use-vault, use-merged (only when a clean merge exists), or abort-this-project |
| project_registration | the current directory has trackable Claude files but is not registered for vault backup | show the trackable paths from detail/data, offer register-now, not-now, or dont-ask-again |
| plugin_install | a plugin the config expects is not installed locally | show the plugin name and marketplace, offer install or skip — installing only relays a command, see Follow-up actions |
| step_failure | a phase hit a mechanical failure it cannot resolve itself and escalated it into a question instead of silently failing the run | render title, then detail/data verbatim, then the choices exactly as given, and tell the operator plainly that a phase turned a mechanical failure into a question |

## Relaying the report

Only exit 0 and exit 20 carry `notes[]`. Take the LAST entry with `key == 'report'`
in that array — it is authoritative (closeout does not promise every prior report note
survives a crash, so a mid-execution kill can leave a stale one behind a fresh one).
If no `report` note is present, report the run's outcome from `phases[]` alone and
say plainly that no report was produced — never fabricate a summary or claim a clean
backup by default.

If `report.degraded` is `true`, report assembly itself threw and some fields may be
`null`: relay what is present, name the missing sections, and treat the run as
problematic regardless of anything else.

`unit_failures` — not `degraded` — decides whether the operator is told something
went wrong: treat the run as problematic when `unit_failures` is non-empty, OR any
entry of `phases[]` has `status: failed`, OR the exit code was 20. `degraded` means
only that report assembly threw; it is `false` on a run that failed real units, so
never read it alone as "everything is fine."

Surface, from the report's fields:

- `ccpraxis_sync` — what merged, what committed, whether the push succeeded; never
  re-promote a captured `push_warnings` protected-ref notice to a failure. Alongside
  it, `preferences.applied` / `preferences.ignored` / `preferences.skip_keys_unmatched`.
  It also carries two purely-informational checks that run every time: `skills` (the
  skills mirror sync — what changed, if anything) and `claude_md` (the global
  CLAUDE.md status check between live and repo). Mention both — a `claude_md` status
  other than `ok` means global CLAUDE.md has drifted, and that is worth surfacing
  even though nothing failed.
- `marketplaces` — anything added or changed.
- `vault_projects.projects[]` — per-slug status and class; read the per-project
  files-pushed/pulled counts from the `sync_counts` entries elsewhere in `notes[]`
  (they are not part of this structure).
- `current_project_registration` — whether the offer fired and the operator's choice;
  **always** mention the skip marker (with `skip_marker_path`, and that deleting it
  re-enables the offer) whenever `skip_marker_present` is `true`, even if no offer
  fired this run.
- `plugins` — `missing`, `extra_installed`, `missing_marketplaces`.
- `snapshots` — `count`, `newest_id`, `newest_version`, `newest_corrupt`, and
  `revert_command` — informational only; never offer or perform a revert during a full
  sync. The revert mode is entered by intent (see **Modes**), never from a report.
- `sources` — a phase that never ran is reported as "never ran", never as "found
  nothing".

## Follow-up actions

On a terminal exit (0 or 20), walk every entry of `follow_up_actions` and act on its
`action` value. Only these four exist; an unrecognised `action` is reported to the
operator verbatim and not acted on.

- **`invoke_setup_project`** (`action`, `cwd`) — emitted only when the operator
  already answered `register_now` on a `project_registration` decision. **Perform**
  it: invoke the `Skill` tool with `steward:setup-project` against `cwd`.
- **`create_skip_marker`** (`action`, `path`) — emitted only when the operator
  already answered `dont_ask_again`. **Perform** it: use `Bash` to create `path`'s
  parent directory first (`mkdir -p`) — it can be missing, since a bare root
  `CLAUDE.md` alone is enough to trigger the offer — then create the empty marker
  file at `path`. Verify the file actually exists afterward before telling the
  operator it was recorded; if creation failed, say so plainly instead of claiming
  success, and tell the operator where the marker is and that deleting it
  re-enables the offer.
- **`install_plugin`** (`action`, `plugin`, `name`, `marketplace`, `command`) —
  emitted when the operator answered `install`. **Relay** it: `/plugin install` is a
  Claude Code client command, not a shell command an agent can execute, so surface
  `command` for the operator to run themselves.
- **`add_marketplace`** (`action`, `marketplace`, `plugin`) — emitted unconditionally
  whenever a marketplace is missing; no question gates it. **Inform only**: tell the
  operator the marketplace is missing and needs `/plugin marketplace add
  <owner>/<repo>` — never act on it automatically yourself, since that would be an
  unconsented mutation reaching through the consent channel. It carries no `command`
  key, so there is nothing to fabricate. `marketplace` is a marketplace *name*, not
  necessarily an `owner/repo` (a directory-source marketplace, for example) — show the
  `<owner>/<repo>` placeholder as-is and let the operator supply the real source, never
  substitute `marketplace`'s value into it.

## Snapshot/revert mode

Entered directly from Modes — this mode never invokes the driver. It always calls
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/claude-binary-backup.pl` instead. Behaviour preserved
unchanged from the prior protocol (skill-before.md:516-575).

1. **List.**
   ```
   perl ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/claude-binary-backup.pl list
   ```
   Parse the JSON. Show a numbered table — id, version, captured_at_utc, reason (if
   present), mark (if present), corrupt flag — newest first. If `count` is 0, tell the
   operator no snapshots exist (probably `/update` was never run) and stop.

2. **Detect.**
   ```
   perl ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/claude-binary-backup.pl detect
   ```
   Surface the current binary's path, version, and SHA-256, so the operator can see
   whether a revert is even needed.

3. **Ask.** Use `AskUserQuestion` to offer: restore the latest snapshot; restore a
   specific snapshot (follow-up: which id, from the list above); verify a snapshot's
   integrity (which id); cancel without changes.

4. **Restore**, if chosen:
   ```
   perl ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/claude-binary-backup.pl restore --latest
   ```
   or, for a specific id:
   ```
   perl ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/claude-binary-backup.pl restore --snapshot <id>
   ```
   The script takes its own pre-restore snapshot before swapping the binary, so the
   restore is itself reversible. Afterward, run `claude --version` to confirm: if it
   matches the restored version, tell the operator and name the pre-restore snapshot
   id as the escape hatch (in case they need to revert the revert). If it fails,
   surface the error, name the pre-restore snapshot id, and do not attempt further
   restores automatically — let the operator decide.

5. **Verify**, if chosen:
   ```
   perl ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/claude-binary-backup.pl verify --snapshot <id>
   ```
   Report the JSON. Exit code 2 means an integrity failure — the snapshot is corrupt
   and cannot safely be restored from. `prune --keep N` auto-removes all corrupt
   entries regardless of the keep-N window; to force-remove a single corrupt snapshot
   without touching others, the operator can delete its directory under
   `~/.claude/backups/claude-code/<id>` manually.
