# update-research.pl -- deterministic release research for /steward:update, with
# a persistence layer so the same facts are never re-derived.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# /steward:update used to be a prose protocol: the agent hand-ran eight
# WebFetches, hand-joined two datasets, hand-computed ages and hand-classified
# risk, every single run. That cost tokens per invocation, drifted between runs,
# and -- measured on 2026-09-06 -- was wrong in three ways that a script cannot
# be:
#
#   1. It read GitHub Releases through a prose summarizer, which returned FIVE
#      releases. The API returns 100 on page one and paginates to three. The
#      protocol then computed release age from a dataset missing 95% of its
#      rows, and had no date at all for most candidate versions.
#   2. Its version-string issue search (`q=...2.1.263+OR+2.1.261+...`) matched
#      every issue filed that day. Zero signal, presented as evidence.
#   3. It re-derived everything on every run. Decline an update and the next
#      invocation pays the identical cost to reach the identical conclusion.
#
# The facts involved are mostly IMMUTABLE -- a published release's date and its
# changelog text never change -- so re-fetching them is pure waste. This script
# stores them once, refreshes only what can actually move (open issues, and the
# tail of the changelog), and recomputes only what is a function of NOW (age,
# and therefore risk).
#
# WHAT IS AND IS NOT CACHED, AND WHY
#
#   versions.json   IMMUTABLE. A version's published_at and changelog body are
#                   facts about a shipped artifact. Fetched once, kept forever.
#                   Refreshed via a conditional GET, so the steady-state cost of
#                   a run is one 304.
#   issues.json     MUTABLE, TTL'd. New crash reports appear and old ones close,
#                   so this expires (default 12h). It is the only thing a
#                   routine re-run actually pays for.
#   decisions.jsonl APPEND-ONLY. What the operator chose and why. This is what
#                   makes the NEXT run smarter rather than merely faster: a
#                   version declined for a named issue can be re-offered when
#                   that issue closes, instead of being re-litigated blind.
#
# Risk is deliberately NOT stored. It is a function of the current time, and a
# cached risk verdict silently rots into a lie the day after it is written.
#
# SUBCOMMANDS
#   status                 Offline. Where the store is, what it holds, how stale.
#   gather                 Refresh what is stale, merge, emit the full analysis.
#   record-decision        Append what the operator chose.
#   history                Past decisions, newest first.
#   sync                   Commit + push the store when it lives in the vault.
#   prune                  Remove legacy/oversized cache artifacts.
#
# All output is a single JSON object on stdout. Errors are JSON too ({ok:0}),
# never a bare die, so the caller always has something to parse.

# appearing was never updated. It kept `state: open` forever and went on
# penalising its version indefinitely. Measured on the real store: 87 issues
# held, 72 of which had never had their state re-checked since first sight.
#
# Absence from a result page is NOT sufficient evidence of closure either --
# with per_page=30 an issue can fall out of the window because newer ones

# curl intact -- but it means every path we hand a native binary must be
# translated by US. The CLAUDE.md rule is explicit that the opt-out and the
# translation are one technique and splitting them is the bug.
