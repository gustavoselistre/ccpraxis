# Scoped commit + push for ONE top-level namespace inside the vault.
#
# WHY THIS IS SHARED RATHER THAN COPIED
#
# The vault holds several root-level namespaces owned by different scripts:
# projects/ (vault-sync.pl), todos/ (legacy, no writer since almanac-records 13),
# reports/ (usage-audit.pl), research/ (update-research.pl). Two of those were writing files that NOTHING
# EVER COMMITTED -- `git status` in the vault on 2026-09-06 showed `reports/`
# and `bootstrap-archive/` as untracked, months of /steward:usage-audit output
# that never reached the remote. The skill said "writes a dated report into the
# vault", and it did; the report just never left the machine.
#
# That is what an owner-per-namespace layout costs when each owner is expected
# to reimplement the same eight git calls. So it lives here once.
#
# SCOPING IS THE POINT. Every git operation is restricted with `-- <relpath>`.
# A bare `git add -A` here would sweep another owner's half-finished work into
# this commit, which is exactly the failure mode a shared vault invites.

# git_path -- POSIX path to something native git.exe can actually open.
#
# Callers set MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL=* so that URLs containing "https:" survive
# being passed to curl. That switches OFF the implicit MSYS translation, which
# means paths must be translated HERE. The project CLAUDE.md is explicit that
# the opt-out and the translation are one technique and splitting them is the
# bug -- a bare /tmp/... reaching native git gets resolved against the current
# drive and created at C:\tmp\, the documented drive-root stray.
#
# The `/c/ -> C:/` rule alone does not cover /tmp, so cygpath (which knows the
# real mount table) is asked first and that rule is only the fallback.
