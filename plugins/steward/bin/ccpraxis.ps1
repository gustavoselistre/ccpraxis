# ccpraxis.ps1 -- thin dispatcher shim for steward's host-side scripts.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The skills that drive these scripts spell out a
# 70-character absolute path on every invocation:
#
#   perl ~/.claude/ccpraxis/plugins/steward/scripts/update-research.pl gather
#
# That works, and the skill file carries it so nothing is being remembered --
# but it is brittle prose. Any move of the tree edits every skill that names
# it, and a typo surfaces as "file not found" rather than anything
# diagnosable. One shim, one PATH entry, paths in exactly one place.
#
# ASCII ONLY, deliberately. The Write tool saves UTF-8 without a BOM and
# PowerShell 5.1 reads a BOM-less script as CP1252, so a character like an
# em dash decodes into stray bytes -- one of which (0x94) is a smart quote
# that PowerShell treats as a STRING DELIMITER. That opens a phantom string,
# swallows the following braces, and reports a missing brace far from the
# real line. Use -- and -> here, never the typographic forms.

# Locate perl from PowerShell (its PATH typically lacks Git Bash's perl). The
# resolver lives in _perl-path.ps1 -- single source of truth, dot-sourced --
# so the shims cannot drift apart.
