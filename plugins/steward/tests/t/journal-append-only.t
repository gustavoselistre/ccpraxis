#!/usr/bin/env perl
# platform: any
# 11 — the sync journal is append-only, and every way that
# could go wrong is pinned here.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. journal_record_op used to read the whole journal, push one
# entry, and write the whole thing back — once per staged file. That is O(n^2).
# Measured on a live run (bug report 20260829-222333-2b23), syncing a project
# with 1495 tracked files:
#
#     .sync-journal.json   1,533,881 bytes   1507 ops
#     20 seconds later     1,539,794 bytes   1513 ops     <- SIX files in 20s
#
# ~3.3 seconds per file and rising, because the per-file cost IS the journal's
# current size. The run passed 90 minutes with ~80 more projected, to move
# 107 MB. Small projects hid it completely.
#
# THE SPLIT INTRODUCED A SECOND FILE INSIDE projects/<slug>/, AND THAT ALMOST
# BRICKED SYNC. vault_dirty_files treats any uncommitted file there as DRIFT, and
# the vault's .gitignore — written once by cmd_init — listed only the header. On
# every existing vault the ops log would have read as uncommitted project content
# and sync-project would have REFUSED TO RUN. The steward suite caught it
# immediately; AC5 below is that regression, pinned.
