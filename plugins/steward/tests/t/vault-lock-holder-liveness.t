# THE VAULT LOCK WROTE THE HOLDER'S PID DOWN AND NEVER READ IT.
#
# acquire_lock records three things about whoever holds the vault lock: session
# id, PID, and a timestamp. Only the timestamp was ever read back. A holder that
# died -- killed, crashed, or taken out along with the whole WSL VM, which is a
# documented failure mode on this host -- left every project in the vault waiting
# out the full $LOCK_STALE_SEC ceiling, with nothing able to tell "someone is
# working" from "nobody is there" (almanac 20260829-193916-e091).
#
# The report called it an indefinite wedge. It is not quite that: a 30-minute
# age-based reclaim has existed since 387309e, so the lock does self-heal. That
# makes this less severe than filed, and still worth fixing -- thirty minutes is
# a backstop, not an answer, and the recorded PID could have answered instantly
# the whole time.
#
# THE ASYMMETRY IS THE POINT, and it is the same one launcher.pl's _pid_alive
# documents: kill(0,...) can prove a process EXISTS, and on ESRCH under a
# foreign PID namespace it proves nothing at all. So only a positive "dead"
# may reclaim. An unknown answer must fall through to the age ceiling -- because
# reclaiming a lock whose holder is still working would let two syncs write the
# vault simultaneously, while waiting thirty minutes merely costs time. Every
# assertion below exists to hold that direction in place.
