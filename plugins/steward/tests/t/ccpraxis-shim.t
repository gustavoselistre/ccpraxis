# 15 — the `ccpraxis` dispatcher shim and its install hook.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The skills that drive steward's scripts spelled out a
# 70-character absolute path on every invocation. That works — the skill file
# carries it, so nothing is being remembered — but it is brittle prose: moving
# the tree edits every skill that names it, and a typo surfaces as "file not
# found" rather than anything diagnosable.
#
# The shim removes that, and in doing so walks straight into two of this
# repo's documented landmines, which is what most of these assertions are for.
#
# AC1  the shim exists on both surfaces, and the install hook that wires it
# AC2  the .ps1 is ASCII-ONLY (PowerShell 5.1 reads BOM-less UTF-8 as CP1252)
# AC3  every subcommand maps to a script that actually exists
# AC4  an unknown subcommand fails loudly rather than silently doing nothing
# AC5  arguments pass through untouched
# AC6  the install hook is discoverable by install.pl's plugins/* glob

# STRING DELIMITER. That opens a phantom string, swallows the following
# braces, and reports a missing brace at a line far from the real one. The
# failure looks like a syntax error somewhere innocent.
