# 16 — two defects found by using the tools, not
# by reading them. Both had shipped, and both were invisible in normal output.
#
# 1. `2>NUL` INSIDE PERL BACKTICKS. claude-binary-backup.pl ended two backtick
#    commands with `2>NUL`. Git-for-Windows perl runs backticks through sh,
#    where NUL is not a device but a FILENAME — so every invocation dropped a
#    literal `NUL` file into the working directory, which Explorer cannot
#    delete. This repo documents that landmine in CLAUDE.md, warns about it in
#    bp-keepawake.pl, and enforces it against Bash commands with a PreToolUse
#    hook — and still shipped it in its own perl. The hook only sees what the
#    agent types; it cannot see inside a perl backtick.
#
#    `2>/dev/null` is NOT the correct fix: it would be wrong the moment
#    backticks go through cmd.exe on a native-Windows perl. The suppression
#    belongs inside PowerShell (-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue), where it is
#    portable. That is bp-keepawake.pl:229's documented reasoning, applied.
#
# 2. A REFRESH TIMESTAMP READ AS A CONFLICT. marketplace-diff stripped
#    installLocation before comparing but not lastUpdated, so a marketplace
#    that had merely been re-fetched reported as "diverged" with byte-identical
#    `source`. The backup skill's diverged branch is written for "the source URL
#    changed" and prompts the user — meaning a routine refresh surfaced as a
#    conflict on every single backup.
#
# AC1  no perl backtick in the steward scripts redirects to NUL
# AC2  running the binary-backup script leaves no NUL file behind (behavioural)
# AC3  marketplace-diff ignores volatile fields, so equal sources read identical
# AC4  ...and still reports a REAL divergence (the counter-check)
