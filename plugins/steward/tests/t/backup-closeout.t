# 24 -- oracle for blueprint backup-driver, package
# 05-closeout-and-report (scripts/backup/Closeout.pm).
#
# Spec: .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/backup-driver/specs/05-closeout-and-report-spec.md
# Scout: .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/backup-driver/reports/05-closeout-and-report/scout-step1.md
#
# Written BLIND to any implementation of Closeout.pm: only the spec, the scout
# report, the SHIPPED scripts/backup/Run.pm, the sibling oracles (t/22, t/23)
# and StewardTest.pm were read. scripts/backup/Closeout.pm is not read or
# stubbed by this file, and this file does not create it.
#
# Harness design (t/13/t/20/t/21/t/22/t/23 local-spawner precedent):
#   * `open '-|', $^X, scripts/backup.pl, 'run', @args`, stderr via a real
#     File::Temp file (never an in-memory scalar).
#   * Three stubs (vault-sync.pl, check-plugins.pl, claude-binary-backup.pl)
#     are written into a scratch <home>/.claude/ccpraxis install at the exact
#     paths Closeout.pm resolves. Each stub's first action is to append its
#     own name + full @ARGV to $ENV{CLOSEOUT_TEST_LOG} -- the call-count /
#     call-order / argv oracle. Each stub then copies a per-(subcommand,
#     call-index) fixture FILE from $ENV{CLOSEOUT_TEST_FIXTURE_DIR} to stdout
#     VERBATIM (:raw, no JSON re-encode) -- this is what makes non-ASCII
#     fixtures byte-exact end to end. A fixture body may be prefixed
#     "EXIT:<n>\n" (non-zero exit), "UNPARSEABLE\n" (junk stdout) or
#     "SIGNAL\n" (the stub kills itself); an absent stub file simulates
#     "cannot spawn" (S8).
#   * The skip marker is NOT a script: fixtures create/omit
#     "<cwd>/.claude/backup-skip" directly on disk.
#   * Cross-phase fixtures (preflight/export/vault outcomes) are seeded by
#     hand-writing a run-state file (the t/21 AC20 / t/22 AC27 / t/23
#     "state-file surgery" precedent) -- BACKUP_PHASE_DIR holds ONLY
#     Closeout.pm, so "preflight"/"export"/"vault" are never discovered or
#     executing phases; get_phase_item reads $state->{phases}{OTHER} as a
#     plain (possibly-absent) hash key regardless.
#   * "cwd" matters here (unlike any earlier phase): Closeout.pm resolves
#     Cwd::cwd() itself (B2), so every scenario chdir()s into a dedicated
#     scratch directory before spawning backup.pl and chdir()s back
#     immediately after -- verified empirically on this host (raw \xNN UTF-8
#     bytes survive chdir()/getcwd()/a spawned child's own Cwd::cwd() call
#     byte-for-byte, both under ASCII and non-ASCII scratch roots).
#   * Non-ASCII fixtures: built from raw \xNN byte literals in THIS file's
#     source (never `use utf8`, never a literal non-ASCII source character),
#     verified by raw substring search against UNDECODED bytes of stdout, the
#     state file and the argv log -- never merely decode_json()+string-eq,
#     which would hide a double-encode.
#
# AC -> test name mapping (grep "AC<n>:" for every assertion of a given
# criterion; several criteria share one scenario the way t/23 does):
#   AC1  phase_spec via direct require, no engine: name/order/resumable/title,
#        no truthy crash_preserves_items
#   AC2  perl -c clean on Closeout.pm and this file
#   AC3  MEGA scenario: unregistered+marker-absent+trackable non-empty ->
#        exactly one project_registration decision, 3 choices, exit 10,
#        resume_token present
#   AC4  unregistered + trackable EMPTY -> zero decisions, exit 0, offered
#        false, trackable_paths == []
#   AC5  unregistered + marker PRESENT -> zero decisions, detect-trackable
#        never spawned, skip_marker fields, registration_skip_marker note
#   AC6  registered:true -> zero decisions, registered+slug reported,
#        detect-trackable never spawned
#   AC7  MEGA scenario resume(register_now) -> follow_up_actions has
#        invoke_setup_project with the pinned cwd; no file created under cwd;
#        vault-sync.pl register never spawned
#   AC8  dont_ask_again -> follow_up_actions has create_skip_marker; marker
#        file does NOT exist on disk afterwards
#   AC9  PLUGINS scenario: missing_plugins status, exit 1, 2 missing entries
#        -> exactly 2 decisions in ONE needs_decision batch, kind
#        plugin_install, ids closeout.plugin_install.<san>, choices
#        install/skip; exit 1 is NOT a unit failure
#   AC10 status ok / no_config -> zero decisions/follow-ups;
#        missing_marketplaces -> add_marketplace follow-ups + note, zero
#        decisions; extra_installed reported, no follow-up
#   AC11 aggregate: every decision seen anywhere validates against
#        Backup::Run::validate_decision(phase=>closeout), kind in exactly
#        {project_registration, plugin_install}; static scan for any other
#        @Backup::Run::DECISION_KINDS literal
#   AC12 MEGA (present) + ABSENT scenario: sources all "present"/all "absent",
#        spot-checked mapped fields, never rendered as empty/success
#   AC13 the single aggregate HASH/ARRAY/CODE/GLOB/SCALAR/Regexp(0x...) regex
#        over every scenario's raw stdout+state bytes collected in this file;
#        trackable_paths exact array; missing_names; preferences.applied[0].key
#   AC14 MEGA vault_projects: 3 statuses -> synced/errored/conflicted, one
#        not_reached/skipped (no project.<tok> item), one unrecognised ->
#        errored with raw status preserved
#   AC15 SNAPSHOTS scenario: count 3 -> newest_id/version; count 0 -> nulls,
#        error null; corrupt newest (manifest null) -> no die; revert_command
#        exact string
#   AC16 EXEC-COUNT scenario: pause+resume, each of the four scripts spawned
#        exactly once across BOTH invocations combined
#   AC17 NON-ASCII CWD scenario: byte-identical --cwd argv, marker probe at
#        the byte-exact path, report cwd byte-identical in stdout+state,
#        survives pause/resume (pinned cwd, B10)
#   AC18 non-ASCII on the other 3 axes: trackable[].path (MEGA), plugin key
#        (PLUGINS), snapshot manifest.version (SNAPSHOTS) -- each independent
#   AC19 CANARY scenario: a cross-phase value never reaches any child argv;
#        positive allow-list check on every logged --cwd/--settings/
#        --installed/--marketplaces value
#   AC20 MUTATES-NOTHING scenario: full scratch-tree snapshot before/after;
#        static scan for filesystem-mutating / git / network operations in
#        Closeout.pm's own source
#   AC21 SIGNAL scenario: a signal-killed check-plugins.pl is not exit 0;
#        plugins.error set, unit_failures.plugins set, phase failed (exit 20)
#   AC22 THREE-OUTCOMES scenario: unspawnable / exit-2 / exit-0-unparseable
#        each produce a DIFFERENT unit_failures.registration message; none
#        reads as "not registered"; none decides; none dies
#   AC23 ENVIRONMENT scenario: HOME/USERPROFILE unset, and $root absent ->
#        exit 20 (never 1/phase_died), report note still present
#   AC24 report structure: hashref, every required top-level key present
#        (including the all-failed path), schema_version==1, no markdown
#        bullet/heading markers in any value
#   AC25 ALL-FAILED scenario: exit 20, report note present, unit_failures
#        names each failed unit; DUPNOTE scenario: the last report note wins
#   AC26 PARITY scenario: four-column header+separator, one row per
#        5.7/6/6.6/7, phase/module cells fixed, exactly 4 cells per row
#   AC27 ISOLATION: real HOME/USERPROFILE captured before any override; no
#        scratch path equals or is derived from them
#
# Extra coverage requested by the dispatch, beyond the numbered ACs:
#   - static scan: Closeout.pm requires/uses none of Run.pm/Preflight.pm/
#     Export.pm/Vault.pm
#   - a vault.project_list entry that is not a hashref, or is missing 'tok',
#     is skipped without dying (the Vault.pm MAJOR 4 lesson, applied here)

# BYTE/CHARACTER SPACE, stated once (coordinator ruling on this file, matching
# P17): every non-ASCII literal in this file ($EACUTE and anything built from
# it) is RAW UTF-8 BYTES, never a decoded Perl character string. Two spaces
# exist and must never be mixed:
#   - BYTE space: raw stdout text ($resp->{out}, @ALL_STDOUT_RAW), raw state-
#     file text (@ALL_STATE_RAW), and the stub argv log -- none of these are
#     ever decode_json()'d by this file, so a raw-byte literal is compared
#     directly (eq/index) against them, correctly.
#   - CHARACTER space: any value read back out of $resp->{json} (decode_json
#     ALWAYS treats its input as UTF-8 bytes and decodes to characters --
#     that is what backup.pl's stdout legitimately contains, since a report
#     field that started as raw UTF-8 bytes round-trips through JSON::PP's
#     encoder-with-no->utf8 unchanged). A raw-byte literal must be
#     Encode::decode('UTF-8', ..., FB_CROAK())'d into this space before it is
#     compared against a decoded structure (hash values, decision fields) --
#     see $EACUTE_WIDE below and its per-scenario *_wide siblings.
# set_fixture() itself writes in BYTE space throughout: JSON::PP's encoder is
# called WITHOUT ->utf8 (matching backup.pl's own convention, S1.8), so a raw-
# byte $EACUTE embedded in fixture data is written to disk unchanged -- never
# re-encoded, which is what a bare ->utf8->encode on already-raw bytes did
# before this fix (each byte re-interpreted as a Latin-1 codepoint and
# UTF-8-encoded AGAIN, corrupting the fixture before Closeout.pm ever read it).

# (current_project_registration.error, plugins.error, snapshots.error,
# unit_failures.report via _record_failure, and the SAME value again inside
# _degraded_report's own unit_failures copy). AC13's fixture-driven
# aggregate cannot see this site (no fixture ever makes $@ a ref); this
# scenario drives it directly, in-process, the way t/22's make_direct_ctx
# already established for exactly this kind of synthetic-$ctx probe: a
# get_phase_item closure that DIES WITH A HASHREF (mirroring Run.pm's own
# `die { code => ..., message => ... }` convention) the moment
# _assemble_report first calls it. HOME/USERPROFILE point at a machine with
# no <home>/.claude/ccpraxis, so run_phase's own B1 sets $env_error and
# skips U1-U5 entirely -- U6 (_run_u6_report/_assemble_report) is reached
# with NO real child process needed at all.
#
# EMPIRICAL FINDING (verified against the shipped module before writing
# this assertion, not assumed): `s/\s+\z//` only MUTATES its target when the
# pattern actually MATCHES, and a bare reference's default stringification
# ("HASH(0x...)") never contains trailing whitespace -- so $err never
# flattens to text; ref($err) survives, unchanged, all the way into the
# report. The regex-based unlike() below is kept (it is what the
# coordinator asked this scenario to feed AC13 with, and it is the correct
# backstop if the mechanism ever DOES produce literal "HASH(0x...)" text);
# it is expected to PASS here, reported explicitly rather than hidden. The
# schema violation that DOES reproduce is narrower and just as real: the
# field is a REF at all, where S2.5 declares every one of these <string|null>.

# COORDINATOR ITEM 7 -- Preflight.pm checkpoints 'sync_skills' (:649) and
# 'check_claude_md' (:680) every run the respective unit succeeds spawning/
# parsing, but Closeout.pm never reads either into the report (grep confirms
# zero occurrences of both checkpoint key strings in Closeout.pm's source),
# so a detected CLAUDE.md drift is currently reported to nobody -- old
# SKILL.md Step 1.5's two reporting duties vanished at the Step 7 relay, a
# step quietly dropped, which is exactly what Decision 8 / the parity
# mechanism exists to catch.
#
# NAMING CARE: the dispatch names these informally as 'skills_synced' and
# 'claude_md_status' -- those are Preflight.pm's NOTE keys (Run.pm-notes,
# each gated on a change/drift condition: skills_synced only fires if
# @changed is non-empty, claude_md_status only fires on
# differs/symlinked_elsewhere/missing_live/missing_repo). get_phase_item is
# CHECKPOINT-ITEM-only (Run.pm's own contract: it reads
# $state->{phases}{$other}{items}, never {notes}) -- so the two keys this
# scenario seeds and Closeout.pm would need to read are the CHECKPOINT keys
# 'sync_skills' and 'check_claude_md', verified directly against
# Preflight.pm's source before writing this fixture, not assumed from the
# dispatch's prose.
#
# SCHEMA CHOICE: both land under ccpraxis_sync, as two NEW sub-keys
# ('skills' and 'claude_md'), not as new TOP-LEVEL report keys. Reasoning:
#   1. ccpraxis_sync ALREADY nests two other preflight-sourced,
#      decision-free, purely-informational facts this exact same way --
#      remote_integration and clone_live -- gated on the identical
#      $pf_present / sources.preflight condition this scenario reuses.
#      Adding here is the SAME convention the dispatch asked for, not a
#      second one.
#   2. Every field that DOES get its own top-level key (preferences,
#      marketplaces, plugins, snapshots) does so because it carries
#      DECISIONS/follow-up actions the wrapper renders distinctly (checked
#      directly: neither 'sync_skills' nor 'check_claude_md' status ever
#      drives a decision kind in @Backup::Run::DECISION_KINDS). Skills-sync
#      and the CLAUDE.md check are purely informational, like
#      remote_integration/clone_live -- not like plugins/marketplaces.
#   3. ccpraxis_sync's own null/present discipline (already gated on
#      sources.preflight || sources.export being present) gives "absent
#      preflight" vs "present but clean" for free, with no second
#      convention invented -- exactly what the dispatch asked for by name.
# If the coordinator rules the other way (a dedicated top-level key),
# only this scenario's key path (ccpraxis_sync.skills / .claude_md instead
# of two new top-level keys) needs to change; nothing else in this file
# depends on the choice.
