# 25-backup-wrapper.t -- oracle for blueprint backup-driver, package
# 06-skill-becomes-wrapper (plugins/steward/skills/backup/SKILL.md, rewritten).
#
# Spec: .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/backup-driver/specs/06-skill-becomes-wrapper-spec.md
#
# Written BLIND to any rewritten implementation of SKILL.md: only the spec, the
# Decision-14 snapshot (reports/skill-before.md), the shipped four parity files
# (reports/parity/02..05-*.md), the shipped scripts/backup/Run.pm (read at
# runtime for its enum, never copied), and the sibling oracle t/24's
# require()/StewardTest/_compile_check idiom were read. This file does not read
# any phase module (Preflight/Export/Vault/Closeout.pm) and does not write or
# assume any future content of SKILL.md.
#
# UNLIKE its four siblings (t/20-24): there is no driver to spawn here, no
# fixture to stub, no encoding boundary to police. This oracle tests PROSE AND
# STRUCTURE -- it parses SKILL.md's frontmatter and body as text, reads
# @Backup::Run::DECISION_KINDS out of the shipped Run.pm at runtime, and parses
# reports/parity/*.md mechanically against the step headings extracted from
# reports/skill-before.md. No StewardTest scratch-vault/spawn helpers
# (make_machine/run_vs/init_remote/temproot/write_text) are imported because
# nothing here spawns a process or writes a scratch fixture to disk -- only
# `ok`/`is`/`like`/`unlike`/`diag`/`done_testing`/`read_text`/`path_exists` are
# used, plus a local File::Temp-backed perl -c self-check (t/24's idiom, never
# an in-memory STDERR dup, never a NUL redirect).
#
# Two hard constraints observed throughout this file's own source (not just its
# assertions):
#   1. No literal copy of @Backup::Run::DECISION_KINDS -- AC10/AC11's whole
#      point is that a 15th kind added to Run.pm must fail this test until
#      SKILL.md documents it, which a hard-coded copy would defeat. The one
#      exception is 'step_failure', named directly because AC12 specifically
#      requires checking THAT kind's row (a single named criterion, not a copy
#      of the list) -- exactly as this package's dispatch explicitly asked for.
#   2. No literal copy of the 15 step ids either -- they are extracted from
#      reports/skill-before.md's own text at runtime (Decision 14: that file is
#      the on-disk source of truth), with the single exception of the literal
#      'R' (again a single named criterion, AC16, not a copy of the list).
#   3. The name of the git subcommand that shelves uncommitted work is never
#      spelled anywhere in this file's source, including comments -- AC9 (no fenced-block line begins
#      with `git`) makes that check unnecessary to spell out, and spelling it
#      risks tripping guard-git-mutations.sh on any Bash command that later
#      greps this file's own text.
#
# AC -> test name mapping (grep "AC<n>:" for every assertion of a given
# criterion):
#   AC1  frontmatter: line 1 is '---', a later '---' closes it, name == backup,
#        description present/non-empty/single-line
#   AC2  user-invocable: true and host-only: true both present
#   AC3  allowed-tools parses to exactly {Bash, AskUserQuestion, Skill};
#        Read/Write/Edit absent
#   AC4  no line matches ^#{1,6}\s+Step\s
#   AC5  all six required headings of spec S2.5 present verbatim
#   AC6  SKILL.md is <= 250 lines
#   AC7  *.pl token set subset of {backup.pl, claude-binary-backup.pl}; every
#        claude-binary-backup.pl occurrence is after the
#        '## Snapshot/revert mode' heading
#   AC8  each of the eleven retired script names is absent
#   AC9  no line inside a fenced code block begins with `git`
#   AC10 Run.pm loaded at runtime via require(); @Backup::Run::DECISION_KINDS
#        read directly, never hard-coded (see header note above)
#   AC11 '## Presenting decisions' table's first-cell values == the enum, as a
#        SET (every enum value present, no extra rows)
#   AC12 'step_failure' specifically has a row with non-empty cells 2 and 3
#   AC13 the 4-cell (parity-shape) table parser trims whitespace, proven by
#        parsing a padded and an unpadded SYNTHETIC row to identical results
#   AC14 '## Snapshot/revert mode' exists and names list/detect/restore/verify
#   AC15 reports/parity/06-skill-becomes-wrapper.md exists, parses to >=1 row,
#        has a row (R, wrapper, plugins/steward/skills/backup/SKILL.md)
#   AC16 exactly 15 step ids extracted from reports/skill-before.md via S2.9's
#        regex, R among them
#   AC17 union of step cells across reports/parity/*.md covers all 15 ids
#   AC18 every reports/parity/*.md file yields >=1 parsed row
#   AC19 a padded row (02's real file) and an unpadded row (03/04/05's real
#        files) both parse via the SAME parser -- against real files, not only
#        synthetic input
#   AC20 every parsed parity row's phase cell is one of
#        {preflight, export, vault, closeout, wrapper}
#   AC21 every parsed parity row's module cell names a path that exists,
#        relative to the repo root
#   AC22 the 06 parity file states Step 1 was defective (a repo hook denies the
#        command as written) and that dirty_worktree is a deliberate change,
#        not preserved behaviour
#   AC23 SKILL.md documents all seven exit codes (0,1,2,3,4,10,20) and what the
#        wrapper does on each; extra checks (not separately numbered by the
#        spec, requested by the parent task) for the exit-4/consumed_seq
#        retry-legitimacy detail and exit-3 token_replayed terminality
#   AC24 '## Relaying the report' states unit_failures (not degraded) decides
#        whether the operator is told something went wrong
#   AC25 '## Follow-up actions' names all four action values and assigns each
#        the perform/relay/inform obligation of S2.4
#   AC26 this file is perl -c clean (self-check below); the "zero exit, zero
#        not ok lines" half of AC26 is a property of the FINAL implemented
#        state and is verified by running this file after the wrapper exists,
#        not by an assertion inside the file (that would be circular)
