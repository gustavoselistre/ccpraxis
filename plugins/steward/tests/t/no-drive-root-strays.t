# 09 — regression guard for the C:\c and C:\tmp leak.
#
# WHAT HAPPENED
#
# On 2026-06-12 a steward test run left 576 entries at the DRIVE ROOT: a full
# mirror of POSIX paths under C:\c (C:\c\Users\Public\steward-*\remote.git — a
# real bare git repo) plus leaked fixtures under C:\tmp. Cause: the suite keeps
# paths in POSIX `/c/...` form because msys-perl's file ops need that, then hands
# them to NATIVE git.exe. Native git cannot resolve a bare `/c/...` when MSYS
# arg-conversion is off, and Windows resolves the leading `/` against the current
# drive — so `/c/Users/Public/x` becomes `C:\c\Users\Public\x`, silently created.
#
# Arg-conversion is off exactly when MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL=* is set, which the
# user-global CLAUDE.md RECOMMENDS as a belt-and-suspenders setting. So the
# hostile configuration is the documented one.
#
# The fix (e52bf17, 2026-06-15) is vault-sync.pl's git_path(): it rewrites
# `/c/...` to `C:/...` before every git call, which native git resolves whether
# or not MSYS rewrites it — independent of the env var rather than fighting it.
#
# WHAT THIS TEST DOES
#
# Runs a real vault flow (clone + git -C operations) with MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL='*'
# deliberately set, then asserts the drive root is untouched. It asserts the flow
# SUCCEEDED first — a sentinel that passes because nothing ran is worthless.
#
# Windows-only for the sentinel; the git_path source guard runs everywhere.
