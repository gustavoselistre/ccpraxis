#!/usr/bin/env perl
# platform: any
# 14 — the update research engine and its persistence layer.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. /steward:update was a prose protocol that made the agent
# hand-fan eight WebFetches, hand-join two datasets, hand-compute ages and
# hand-classify risk on every single run. Measured on 2026-09-06 it was wrong
# three ways at once: it read GitHub Releases through a prose summarizer that
# returned 5 of 100 releases, its version-string issue query matched every issue
# filed that day, and it re-derived everything each time so declining an update
# cost the same as taking one.
#
# The assertions below pin the properties a script can hold and a protocol
# cannot: correct ordering, cache reuse, offline capability, byte-correct paths,
# an append-only decision log, and a sync that stays inside its own namespace.
#
# Every test runs the REAL script as a subprocess against a temp HOME, with
# --offline and a pre-seeded store. No test here touches the network or the
# operator's actual vault.
#
# AC1  version comparison is numeric, so 2.1.90 sorts below 2.1.219
# AC2  risk is derived from the clock at run time, never read from the store
# AC3  a bundled-runtime crash cluster demotes every version at or above it
# AC4  the recommendation refuses HIGH, NO_CHANGELOG, issue-named and cluster versions
# AC5  --offline produces a full analysis with no network access
# AC6  a store path containing non-ASCII round-trips byte-for-byte
# AC7  decisions.jsonl is append-only and survives re-runs
# AC8  sync commits ONLY its own namespace, never a sibling's work
