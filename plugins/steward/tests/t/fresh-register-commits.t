# 12 — a fresh registration's FIRST commit must
# actually store the files, and must not poison the cache if it does not.
#
# Bug report 20260901-025445-d667. Registering the ccpraxis dev clone
# (4405 files), the first commit-and-push returned `committed_and_pushed` while
# rolling back all 4405 push ops. Nothing was committed: the vault held 201 MB
# of unrenamed *.vault-sync.tmp staging, invisible to `git status` because that
# pattern is in the vault's own .gitignore, and `git ls-files` showed only
# metadata.json.
#
# The SECOND sync then staged `delete_local` for every file — 4405 deletions,
# zero pushes — because the cache had recorded the files as synced even though
# the push ops rolled back. local == cache + vault absent reads as "deleted
# upstream". It reported `status: synced` while staging the deletion of every
# bug report, blueprint and correction note in the project.
#
# Two claims, and the second is the one that turns a failed backup into data
# loss:
#   AC1  a fresh registration's first commit actually commits its files
#   AC2  after a sync, the next sync does not want to DELETE anything local

# AC3 — A ROLLED-BACK PUSH MUST NOT LEAVE A CACHE ENTRY BEHIND.
#
# This is the mechanism of the data loss, tested directly rather than through
# the (still unidentified) trigger that made 4405 pushes roll back.
#
# A push rolls back when its source changes between staging and rename. So:
# stage a sync, then modify the source before commit-and-push. The push rolls
# back for a legitimate reason — and the question is whether its cache op rolls
# back with it.
#
# If it does not, the cache claims a sync that never reached the vault, and the
# NEXT sync reads local == cache + vault-absent as "deleted upstream" and stages
# delete_local. That is how a failed backup becomes deleted work.
#
# THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS CASE WAS VACUOUS, and the way it failed is worth
# recording. It made the push roll back by MODIFYING the source after staging —
# which also makes cache != local, so the next sync reads "local changed", pushes
# again, and never reaches the delete path. It passed with the fix disabled.
#
# The real incident had cache == local with the vault EMPTY: nothing had changed
# locally, the pushes simply never landed. So the reproduction has to make the
# push fail for a reason UNRELATED to the source content — here by removing the
# staged vault-side tmps, which triggers the tmp-missing rollback while the cache
# ops still carry the current content.

# AC5 — A NON-ASCII PATH MUST SURVIVE THE JOURNAL ROUND-TRIP.
#
# The ACTUAL root cause of 20260901-025445-d667, found only after the tmp-filter
# fix above failed to change the outcome. AC4 was a real bug and made every run
# worse, but it was not what broke the backup.
#
# sync-project and commit-and-push are SEPARATE PROCESSES that hand each other
# file paths through the ops journal. The journal's log half was read with a bare
# `JSON::PP->new->decode`, which returns utf8-FLAGGED strings. A path through
# `André` came back as the characters `Ã©`, perl re-encoded that on the way to
# Windows, and the resulting path did not exist -- so `-f $op->{tmp_path}` was
# false for EVERY push, all 4414 rolled back with tmp_missing, and the backup
# reported success having stored nothing. The files were on disk the entire
# time; `ls` found them and `-f` did not.
#
# read_json() had re-encoded to bytes since it was written. The append-only log
# was added later and skipped that step, so the two halves of one journal
# disagreed about what a filename was.
#
# WHY THE SUITE STAYED GREEN THROUGH ALL OF IT: temproot() resolves to
# /c/Users/Public — pure ASCII. Every path this suite has ever tested round-trips
# byte-identically whether or not the flag is set. The real vault lives under
# `André`. So the bug was unreachable from the tests by construction, and no
# amount of running them harder would have found it.
#
# Hence a non-ASCII FILENAME rather than a non-ASCII root: it reproduces the
# fault wherever the test root happens to live.
#
# The first attempt at this fix used `->decode` + re-encode, which DOUBLE-encoded
# (bytes read as Latin-1, then encoded again) and left the failure identical.
# `->utf8->decode` is what makes the pair symmetric with the writer.
