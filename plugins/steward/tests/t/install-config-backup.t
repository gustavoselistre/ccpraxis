# 13 — installing must not destroy a config the user
# already had.
#
# Bug report 20260901-140408-f661. The install replaces ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md with
# a symlink (or merges into it) and copies/merges ~/.claude/settings.json.
# Nothing took a backup first, while /steward:backup takes a timestamped one for
# the same settings.json on every routine run. The protection existed on the
# repeatable path and was missing from the irreversible one.
#
# The README could therefore only tell the user to restore "from a backup if you
# kept one" — asking them to have done something we were better placed to do, at
# the one moment the original still existed.
#
# AC1  an existing config is copied aside, and the copy matches the original
# AC2  a second run does not overwrite the first backup
# AC3  a missing file is skipped, never created
# AC4  a file ALREADY symlinked by a prior install is not archived as if it were
#      the user's own
