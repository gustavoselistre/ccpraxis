#!/usr/bin/env perl
# platform: any
# 23 -- oracle for blueprint backup-driver, package
# 04-vault-and-todos (scripts/backup/Vault.pm).
#
# Spec: .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/backup-driver/specs/04-vault-and-todos-spec.md
# (including its BINDING coordinator rulings P14/P15 in S0, which are the whole
# reason this file insists on non-ASCII FILENAMES, not merely non-ASCII file
# content -- see .ccpraxis-local-data/bug-reports/20260901-025445-d667.md).
#
# This test is written BLIND to any implementation of Vault.pm: only the spec,
# scout-step1.md, the SHIPPED scripts/backup/Run.pm, t/backup-export.t /
# t/backup-preflight.t (harness patterns), StewardTest.pm and the d667 bug
# report were read. Do not read scripts/backup/Vault.pm while editing this file.
#
# Harness design (full rationale in the accompanying report):
#   * Local-spawner pattern (t/13/t/20/t/21/t/22 precedent): `open '-|', $^X,
#     scripts/backup.pl, 'run', @args`, stderr captured via a real File::Temp
#     file (never an in-memory scalar -- Git-for-Windows "Bad file descriptor").
#   * A stub for vault-sync.pl (JSON) is
#     written under a scratch HOME's fake `<home>/.claude/ccpraxis` install.
#     Both log their own name + argv to $ENV{VAULT_TEST_LOG} as their first
#     action -- the invocation-order/argv/call-count oracle every AC below
#     relies on.
#   * Per-(subcommand, slug, call-index) fixture FILES under
#     $ENV{VAULT_TEST_FIXTURE_DIR} let a scenario script a sequence such as
#     "list-projects call 0 (U3) returns the frozen list; call 1 (S2.7
#     confirmation after project A's push) shows A's last_synced_at advanced".
#     A response file may be prefixed "EXIT:<n>\n" to make the stub exit
#     non-zero. Fixture bytes are read/written `:raw` throughout and printed
#     by the stub VERBATIM (no JSON re-encode in the stub) -- this is what
#     makes the non-ASCII fixtures (P15) byte-exact end to end: the stub never
#     touches the bytes, it only ever copies them.
#   * P15: fixture filenames/slugs are built from raw \xNN byte literals in
#     THIS file's source (never `use utf8`, never a literal non-ASCII source
#     character) so the fixture's byte identity does not depend on how this
#     .t file itself happens to be saved/read. Verified by raw substring
#     search against undecoded bytes (stdout, the state file, the argv log),
#     not merely by decode_json()+string-eq (see the report for the exact
#     verification methodology).
#   * "State-file surgery, not a real kill" (t/21 AC20 / t/22 AC27 precedent)
#     simulates a mid-execution death for the crash_preserves_items scenarios:
#     hand-write a run-state file with phases.vault.status='running' (not
#     'paused') and phase items pre-populated, then invoke a bare `run` (no
#     --resume) and let Run.pm's own R6 logic decide what survives.
#
# AC -> test name mapping (grep for "AC<n>:" to find every assertion for a
# given criterion; a few criteria are exercised by more than one block):
#   AC1  DC1 sequential-in-code: 3-project ordering log + static no-fork/no-threads/no-Parallel:: scan
#   AC2  DC1/DC2 seeded state (project2 checkpointed, project1 not) works on project1, not project2
#   AC3  DC8 phase_spec via direct require, no engine
#   AC4  DC3 vault absent -> complete, one vault_missing note, zero spawns
#   AC5  DC2 exact spawn counts across a pause/resume (list-projects 1+confirms, sync-project once/project)
#   AC6  DC2/DC5 checkpoint keys after a project-B pause; resume does not re-spawn A's sync-project
#   AC7  DC5 checkpoint lives at phases.vault.items.project.<tok>.data; no other file created anywhere
#   AC8  DC3 drift for project1 of 2 -> project2 still processed, exit 20, no commit-and-push for project1
#   AC9  DC3 sync-project error / exit-1 emit_error / unparseable -- three distinct outcomes, never collapsed
#   AC10 DC3 list-projects unparseable -> failed phase, zero sync-project spawns, never "0 projects" success
#   AC11 DC4 text conflict exit_code==1 -> exactly 1 decision, merge_preview has both versions, 3 choices
#   AC12 DC4 text conflict exit_code==0 -> offers use_merged; answering spawns --merged-file <tmp_path>
#   AC13 DC4 binary conflict -> no use_merged, is_text false, merge_exit_code null
#   AC14 DC4 aggregate: every decision emitted anywhere validates, only kind vault_conflict, id grammar
#   AC15 DC1/DC4 two conflicts same project = one batch; two projects = two pauses, 2nd after 1st committed
#   AC16 DC3 abort_project -> zero further resolve-conflict/commit-and-push, note, continue, not a phase failure
#   AC17 DC6 rolled_back_nothing_stored -> exact checkpoint status, failure, never described as synced
#   AC18 DC6 sensitive_blocked / sensitive_blocked_post_rename distinct from each other and from rollback
#   AC19 DC6 committed_and_pushed + rolled_back_during_sync -> still success, extra note
#   AC20 DC6 push_unconfirmed (stale last_synced_at) vs confirmed (advanced) -- failure vs success
#   AC21 DC6 signal-killed vault-sync.pl during commit-and-push is NOT exit 0; project fails
#   AC22 DC2/DC4 missing session_id -> session_missing, zero resolve/commit; happy path session id byte-identical across resume
#   AC23 DC3 environmental degradation never dies: no HOME, missing root, unspawnable child, unreadable merge tmp
#   AC24 DC2/DC4 P15 non-ASCII FILENAME byte-exact through decision/stdout/checkpoint/resumed argv
#   AC25 DC2/DC4/DC5 P15 non-ASCII SLUG -- ASCII tok/checkpoint-key/id, byte-exact --slug and notes
#   AC26 DC1 the vault phase completes with zero registered projects and exactly one child spawn
#   AC27 DC3 deletes_local note appears before the commit-and-push invocation for that project
#   AC28 DC3 stale entry -> note, zero refresh/sync spawns, continue, terminal status unaffected alone
#   AC29 DC8 isolation: no real HOME/USERPROFILE, no real vault, no network remote, everything under scratch
#   AC30 DC7 parity file: fixed four-cell row shape, floor of the five old-step rows, no 5.6 row required
#   AC31 DC8 perl -c clean on both files
#   AC32 DC4/DC5 source scan: no require Run/Preflight/Closeout.pm; no literal git invocation; only vault_conflict kind literal
#
# Extra coverage beyond the numbered ACs, explicitly requested by the dispatch:
#   CRASH1/CRASH2  crash_preserves_items: a simulated mid-execution death preserves a completed
#                  project's checkpoint (not re-synced) AND a preserved-but-unanswered conflict's
#                  stored answer is cleared (re-asked with the SAME decision id)

# ===========================================================================
# ITEM6 -- coordinator MAJOR (conflict batch exceeds the argv limit):
# investigated empirically rather than asserted. Vault.pm/Run.pm/backup.pl
# never invoke a shell (S1.5's own "never a shell string" contract, and this
# oracle's own spawner matches it: `open '-|', $^X, @args` is Perl LIST-form
# exec, never a flattened command string). Measured directly on this host:
# spawning $^X via LIST-form open with several HUNDRED "--answer id=choice"
# arguments (up to ~663,000 total characters, roughly 20x the commonly-cited
# 32,767-character Windows command-line ceiling) still spawns successfully
# every time -- list-form exec on this Perl/Windows combination does not
# hit a practical argv wall at anything resembling "a few hundred
# conflicts". Separately, routing the SAME kind of long argument list
# through an actual shell (`cmd /c ...` as a flattened string) DOES fail
# ("The command line is too long.") at under 25,000 characters -- but that
# is cmd.exe's own limit on a shell-string invocation, a code path this
# module and this oracle both deliberately never take, and asserting it
# here would be testing cmd.exe, not Vault.pm. I cannot reproduce the
# described spawn failure at this layer without routing through a shell
# Vault.pm itself never uses, so per the coordinator's own instruction I am
# not inventing a threshold-based assertion. The real risk is architectural
# (an operator's own interactive shell, or whatever wrapper eventually
# invokes `backup.pl run --resume --answer ...` for a real paused run, may
# have a materially lower limit than this harness's own invocation
# mechanism) and its fix is batching the conflict set across multiple
# resumable sub-batches, or accepting answers via a file/stdin instead of
# positional argv -- neither of which this black-box oracle can assert
# without either fabricating a non-reproducing threshold or exercising a
# shell-invocation code path unrelated to this module's own contract.

# The blocks below (M1, M1c, M2/M2G, M3, MF1, SF1, SF2, SF4, SF6, S1) were
# added/rewritten by review 16-review.md and its round-2 re-review
# (16-rereview.md, mutation-proven): the original coverage had no failure-
# path test for a mid-window deletion race, a skip's blast radius, a
# pull-side concurrent local edit, or CRLF idempotence -- and the re-review
# found the FIRST round's M1/M2 blocks vacuous (mutating the real fix left
# them green). Written BLIND to vault-sync.pl / Vault.pm exactly as the rest
# of this file's package-16 section is (see the header at the top of this
# file), except for reading the seam's own doc comment in vault-sync.pl
# (blueprint Decision 43) to learn its exact contract -- the seam IS the
# spec for these blocks, the same way Almanac::Store/Almanac::Lock are.
#
# Decision 43's seam: CCPRAXIS_VAULT_SYNC_TEST_PAUSE=<dir>, set in the CHILD
# env before spawning vault-sync.pl. Inside each almanac store lock window,
# AFTER every local hash/enumeration for that window is taken and BEFORE its
# staging proceeds, it creates <dir>/in-window, then polls (bounded to 30s)
# for <dir>/release before letting the window continue. Every record lock
# and the store's own lock are held for the WHOLE pause -- that is what lets
# a test prove a concurrent writer is genuinely blocked, not just that
# enumeration happened before some later step.
# ===========================================================================

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Round-2 async-spawn plumbing: the seam makes vault-sync.pl block mid-run,
# so exercising it needs a spawn that does NOT wait for output (unlike
# run_vs, which always reads to EOF). Every wait below is bounded: the
# poll-until-file helpers (bp16_wait_for_file, pre-existing) have their own
# deadline, and the two genuinely-blocking operations -- reading the async
# child's stdout to EOF, and reaping it -- are wrapped in an alarm() so a
# script that never exits cannot hang this test file. Every pause directory
# is registered for a best-effort release at process exit (END), so a died
# assertion mid-block never leaves a vault-sync.pl process waiting out the
# seam's own 30s cap.
