# 17 — block-nul-redirect.pl still blocks, and now has a
# way to say "this one is a false positive".
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The hook reads the Bash command as TEXT and has no quote
# awareness, so it blocks `grep '>NUL' .` and a quoted test fixture exactly as
# hard as a real redirect. Three fired in one session on 2026-09-06, one of
# them while writing the regression test for the very bug the hook guards. A
# rule you cannot write tests about is self-defeating.
#
# The strictness is NOT relaxed, and the reason is worth stating because the
# obvious fix is wrong: making the regex quote-aware means stripping quoted
# spans before matching, and `cmd 2>"NUL"` quotes the TARGET while still
# creating the file. That change would trade a cheap false positive (a retry)
# for an expensive false negative (an undeletable file). So the pattern stays
# and the caller gets an explicit, logged override instead.
#
# AC1  real redirects are still blocked, in every shape
# AC2  a mention that is not a redirect is still blocked WITHOUT the override
#      (the strictness is intact — this is not a quote-aware rewrite)
# AC3  the override lets a mention through
# AC4  the override demands a substantive reason; `=1` is refused
# AC5  the block message teaches the override, or nobody can use it
# AC6  a command with no NUL at all is untouched
