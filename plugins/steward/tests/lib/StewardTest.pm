# StewardTest — minimal test harness for the steward vault engine.
#
# Provides: a tiny TAP-ish assertion API (ok/is/like/unlike/diag/done_testing)
# and integration helpers that run vault-sync.pl against a HOME-overridden,
# file://-bare-remote scratch vault so tests never touch the real
# ~/.claude/claude-code-vault.
#
# HOME-isolation: vault-sync.pl reads $ENV{HOME} // $ENV{USERPROFILE} ONCE at
# file scope, so HOME/USERPROFILE must be set in the CHILD env BEFORE the script
# is spawned. run_vs() does exactly that (each call is a fresh subprocess), which
# is why every scenario step shells out instead of calling subs in-process.

# ($name), so $cond becomes the (truthy) name string and the assertion passes
# with $name undef -- a real false-pass measured in 16-mutation-r2.md
