#
# Spec section 2.3/2.4: writing /etc/profile.d/backpack-path.sh is NOT
# sufficient to close the reinstall loop, because the install pass runs
# every verify/install command through a non-login `bash -c` (run_bash),
# which never sources /etc/profile.d. The fix is `$ENV{PATH}` set
# IN-PROCESS, in the parent backpack.pl process, before the loop begins
# (cmd_install) and again for cmd_audit (no disk write).
#
# THE DISTINGUISHING DESIGN, spelled out because it is the entire point of
# this file: --profile-path below points at a path this test never sources
# and bash never sources either (it isn't /etc/profile.d, it's a tempdir).
# So if an implementation writes the fragment file correctly but never
# touches $ENV{PATH} in the parent process, the confirming `verify` (a bare
# `command -v <name>`, run in a FRESH bash -c child that inherits only the
# unmodified process environment) has no way to find the fake binary and
# MUST fail. Only an implementation that actually augments $ENV{PATH} before
# spawning that child can make this pass. A "wrote the file, forgot the env"
# implementation is red here even though it would be green on a naive test
# that merely inspects the fragment's bytes (see profile-fragment.t,
# which is deliberately silent on this point).
#
# AC7: bare-command install/verify succeeds within a single install pass.
# AC8: re-running install does not re-trigger install (SKIP, not FAIL-retry)
#      -- the reinstall loop itself is closed, not just one pass of it.
# AC9: cmd_audit reports the same item present, with NO --profile-path and
#      NO disk write.
