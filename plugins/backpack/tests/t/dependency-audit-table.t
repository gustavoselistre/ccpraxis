# ORACLE for b01-backpack-install-accounting criterion 4's required artifact
# (spec section 2.3 "The required audit table", case 9 of spec section 3),
# written BLIND to any implementation -- backpack.pl at HEAD has no `deps`
# subcommand and no concept of "load-bearing position" at all.
#
# OPERATOR DECISION 2026-08-13 (recorded in the spec verbatim): this host has
# zero real backpack entries (`.ccpraxis-local-data/claude-home/backpack.json`
# holds none), so the audit table is demonstrated against a SYNTHETIC fixture
# mirroring the incident's item shape -- including the six named items
# (curl-script:gh, curl-script:google-cloud-sdk, curl-script:jdk21,
# curl-script:flutter, curl-script:node, project-setup:gh-auth depending on
# gh). This file does NOT pad the fixture to a literal 15 items: the other
# nine would be undocumented filler carrying no test signal, and the spec's
# own instruction is to mirror the SHAPE, not fabricate a specific count.
#
# The spec requires the table to be labeled, IN THE OUTPUT, as fixture-
# derived and NOT an audit of the operator's real entries. backpack.pl has
# no way to know at runtime whether a given file is "real" or "synthetic" --
# that fact lives with whoever is invoking it -- so this commits to a
# `--note TEXT` flag (the same "explicit hand-off" pattern as `--declared` in
# install-declared-reconciliation.t) that stamps the caller-supplied text
# verbatim into the report header. This test supplies the fixture-derived
# disclaimer via --note and asserts it comes through unaltered.
