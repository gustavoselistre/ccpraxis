# ORACLE for b01-backpack-install-accounting criterion 5 (spec section 2.4,
# case 8 of spec section 3), written BLIND to any implementation. Reproduces
# the incident's actual misattribution shape: `project-setup:gh-auth` fails
# exit 127 BECAUSE `gh` was never installed, but at HEAD the only signal a
# reader sees is gh-auth's own FAIL line -- nothing at all names `gh`.
#
# Uses the same --declared reconciliation interface as
# install-declared-reconciliation.t (see that file's header for why this
# specific CLI shape was chosen: launcher.pl can never be executed by this
# suite, so backpack.pl's CLI is the only testable home for the declared-vs-
# processed comparison the "N never reached install" peer fact needs).

# Case 8 (spec section 3 #8): an exit-127 failure whose dependency never
# installed surfaces the missing dependency, AND the "N never reached
# install" fact is present as a PEER fact (not a footnote beneath the FAIL
# line -- an un-indented line of its own, per spec section 2.4).
#
# Fixture mirrors the incident exactly: `curl-script:gh` is DECLARED but
# never made it into the install-set (the silent upstream drop); `gh-auth`
# depends_on gh and its install command invokes a binary that genuinely does
# not exist on this host, reproducing the real exit-127 signature (rather
# than asserting an exact code some other tool coincidentally also returns).
