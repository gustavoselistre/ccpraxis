# p01-sandbox-plugin-provisioning — driver correction after implementer-step4:
# the operator's decision log (blueprint decision entry 2026-08-14T00:50:44Z,
# "ONE-TIME REMOVAL OF THESE TWO, THEN WARN-ONLY") authorises removal of the
# two NAMED pre-manifest legacy skill specimens (`plan`, `work-plan`) as a
# CALLER-SIDE one-time pass, distinct from PluginSync::prune_orphaned_dirs's
# STANDING policy (empty -> remove; content-bearing -> warn, never remove,
# t/82's AC-6/AC-7 — untouched and NOT re-covered here).
#
# t/skills-prune-orphaned-dirs.t's own header says this explicitly:
#   "ONE-TIME (caller-gated, not this function's concern): empty unowned
#   directories ARE removed."
# — i.e. AC-6/AC-7 pin prune_orphaned_dirs's function-level contract only;
# they say nothing about a caller that ALSO explicitly names two specimens for
# one-time removal via a SEPARATE function. This file pins that separate
# function, PluginSync::remove_named_legacy_dirs, added specifically so the
# caller (launcher.pl) has a hard-coded, non-predicate-derived removal path
# for exactly those two names — never a general "delete content-bearing dirs"
# primitive.
#
# Every assertion here is ADDITIVE coverage: nothing in t/82 is touched, and
# nothing here asserts anything about prune_orphaned_dirs's own removed/warned
# semantics for arbitrary directories.

# to call again even if the gate were ever bypassed by accident, though the
