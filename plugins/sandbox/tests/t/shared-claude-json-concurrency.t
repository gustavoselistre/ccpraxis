# Shared claude-home/.claude.json — no corruption under real concurrency,
# on the REAL 9p/drvfs dir bind (s01 row 13, s02 spec §3 B42-B51).
#
# This is the in-container proof that the row 1/3 fix (delete the writable
# single-file bind onto /root/.claude.json, add CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/root/.claude
# so the CLI resolves the config to an ordinary file inside the RW dir bind)
# actually holds up under concurrent readers/writers on the filesystem that
# matters — not /tmp, not tmpfs, the real bind. It also proves the launcher's
# NEW mkdir-based, mtime-stale-safe lock (row 5) behaves correctly on that
# same bind, where a probe already showed mtime granularity is WHOLE SECONDS
# (probe-01 §E) and a plain FILE can occupy the lock path just as validly as
# a directory (probe-01 §B — Claude Code's own lock artefact kind is not
# guaranteed).
#
# B42 (skip-as-pass). We parse /proc/self/mountinfo for a mount point EXACTLY
# /root/.claude. Directory existence alone is not evidence of a mount (a bare
# `/root/.claude` could exist on a host run with no container at all) so we
# never substitute -d for this check. Absent -> skip_all, exit 0.
#
# B43 (blast radius). Every write in this file lands under a fresh scratch
# directory /root/.claude/.t42-<pid>-<epoch>/, inside the real dir bind so the
# real rename/mkdir/utime semantics are exercised. The live
# /root/.claude/.claude.json is NEVER written, renamed, locked or unlinked —
# a production fleet depends on it right now. We assert this continuously:
# this file's own live-mtime-unchanged check runs unconditionally, not only
# in a SKIP branch. Cleanup is Perl-level (File::Path::remove_tree, an END
# block, no shell rm -rf — the guard-bash hook forbids recursive shell
# deletes outside /tmp, and this scratch lives in claude-home).
#
# B44/B45/B46 (Phase A). Three writer processes (w1, w2, and a launcher-style
# writer wL exercising the very same mkdir-lock + temp+rename protocol
# _write_file_atomic/_config_lock_acquire will use — this file cannot
# `require launcher.pl`, so it is a small, faithful in-test reimplementation)
# perform read-modify-write against one scratch .claude.json while an
# unsynchronized reader samples it as fast as it can. The oracle is TWO
# things, not one: (a) the reader never observes a torn/unparseable/unopenable
# file (the corruption oracle) and (b) EVERY writer's own last confirmed
# counter is exactly what's in the final file (the lost-update oracle — valid
# JSON at the end is blind to silently dropped writes, which is exactly the
# false-green s01's own harness produced once).
#
# B47 (Phase B). The REAL /root/.local/bin/claude binary drives >=5
# config-mutating `mcp add`/`mcp remove` invocations against a SECOND scratch
# CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR (so the CLI's own config shape can't collide with Phase
# A's marker-key oracle) while a reader samples. Degrades to SKIP (not a
# failure) if the binary is missing or the phase's budget is blown.
#
# B48 (Phase C). Direct measurement of the lock primitives on the real bind:
# mkdir works; mtime measurably advances (given the whole-second granularity,
# via an explicit cross-boundary sleep + utime, matching probe-01's method);
# uncontended acquisition is fast; a stale lock is taken over whether it is a
# directory OR a plain file at the lock path; a fresh lock is respected (the
# acquire attempt fails within its own timeout, and nothing gets written).
#
# B49/B50 (Phase D). One more explicit EBUSY-free atomic rename at the
# post-fix path SHAPE (inside the dir bind, not the old single-file mount);
# then a READ-ONLY assertion that the real live config still parses and still
# carries its onboarding keys — never a write.
#
# B51 (runtime budget). Total wall time target ~20s, hard ceiling 60s. Each
# phase is internally time-bounded and additionally reaped under a watchdog
# so a stuck child degrades the phase to SKIP rather than hanging the suite.
#
# Traceability: AC15, AC17, AC18, AC19, AC20, AC21, AC22, AC26.

# _recovers($file, $jp) -> 1 if a bounded re-read returns a non-empty, parseable
# document; 0 if the file is STILL empty/unopenable after the retry window.
#
# This is the line between "the mount blinked" and "the config is destroyed".
# Pre-fix, a torn config stayed 0-byte until something healed it; post-fix, a
# zero-length sighting is a coherency artefact that clears on the next read.
# Bounded at ~250ms so a genuinely destroyed file still fails the test fast.

# THE READ PRIMITIVE. Ruling A (2026-07-28) rejected the earlier design, which
# counted a transient zero-length read as a real observation and then permitted
# it under a percentage ceiling. The criterion says the shared config is NEVER
# observed 0-byte, and the ruling is right that "transient" is not self-evidently
# harmless: a reader that can see an empty config can act on it (Claude Code's
# own corrupt-config path renames it aside and re-runs onboarding).
#
# So the window is CLOSED here rather than tolerated: a read that comes back
# empty or unparseable is retried over a bounded window before it is believed.
# This is not the test looking away — it mirrors what the production path
# already does (`ensure_claude_json_onboarded` retries a zero-length read that
# contradicts a non-zero `-s`, the redteam-C2 fix). What the assertions below
# then measure is the real question: can a CORRECTLY-IMPLEMENTED reader ever
# observe a 0-byte config? The answer must be no, with no ceiling and no
# exceptions. probe-02 keeps the record of the underlying 9p behaviour that
