# s17-statusline-and-output-hygiene: sandbox indicator, output hygiene while
# the alt-screen is owned, fork-cadence reduction, and current-session
# heartbeat filtering.
#
# This file is the IMMUTABLE ORACLE for blueprint sandbox-butler-overhaul,
# package s17-statusline-and-output-hygiene
# (specs/s17-statusline-and-output-hygiene-spec.md). Written BLIND to any
# launcher.pl / Dashboard.pm / statusline.pl / settings.json implementation --
# directly from the spec -- so it serves as an oracle rather than an echo of
# whatever the implementer eventually writes. Do NOT weaken an assertion to
# make a future implementation's life easier.
#
# Coverage: C1..C10 (spec S6).
#
# HARD CONSTRAINTS honoured here (spec S6 preamble / dispatch hazards):
#   * NEVER spawns launcher.pl, never builds an image, never starts a
#     container. launcher.pl is SLURPED for source-text assertions only
#     (t/48/t/59's established convention) -- never require'd/do'ne.
#   * scripts/statusline.pl IS spawned (bound by `timeout`) -- it is a plain,
#     non-interactive filter script (stdin JSON -> stdout text), not
#     launcher.pl, and the write-set ruling (spec S1) puts the sandbox
#     indicator there, so executing it is the only way to prove C1/C2.
#   * Fixtures live only under File::Temp tempdir()s/tempfile()s.
#
# NAMING NOTE (recorded, not invented): the spec gives the sandbox env var as
# an EXAMPLE ("e.g. CCPRAXIS_SANDBOX=1"), repeated identically in both the
# spec and the package ledger, rather than a pinned literal. This oracle
# treats that example as the expected name but discovers it from
# container/settings.json's own `env` block at run time (any key matching
# /SANDBOX/i with a truthy value), so a differently-but-reasonably-named var
# is not penalized. See the report for what was discovered.
