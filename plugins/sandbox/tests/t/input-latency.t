# s15: oracle for the new `wait_input` seam in Dashboard::run().
#
# Spec: .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-butler-overhaul/specs/s15-spec.md
#
# THE CHANGE (not made by this file): replace the unconditional tail
#   $sleep_for->($tick_int);
# with an interruptible wait behind a new injected seam
#   my $wait_input = $o{wait_input} || sub { $sleep_for->($_[0]); undef };
# so a keypress wakes the loop immediately (drained + rendered THAT SAME
# TICK), while an idle loop still waits ~tick_int with no busy-spin. The
# default (no wait_input injected) must be byte-for-byte today's behaviour.
#
# This file is a READ-ONLY consumer of Dashboard::run()'s seam contract; it
# does not modify Dashboard.pm, launcher.pl, or t/dashboard-framework.t.

# many times it was called, and (c) the exact ordering of side effects
# (heartbeats/gathers/spawns/frames) around each call.
