#!/usr/bin/env perl
# platform: any
# 79 -- ORACLE for package t01 (blueprint
# butler-and-dashboard-overhaul), specs/t01-spec.md. Derived
# from the spec's §4 observable behaviors and §5 acceptance criteria, and
# from the package's own done criteria. WRITTEN BLIND TO
# plugins/sandbox/scripts/tui/DashboardScreen.pm's eventual edit -- every
# fixture's shape was verified only against UNCHANGED, already-shipped
# helpers (_spend_body/_spend_*_spans, _token_body, _run_summary_lines,
# row(), fmt_duration()) as they exist today, per the spec's own claim that
# those helpers are reused, not rewritten. Do NOT weaken an assertion here
# to make a future implementation's life easier.
#
# THE OPERATOR'S COMPLAINT IS AMBIGUITY OF REFERENT, NOT SCREEN ECONOMY --
# "it's now not even clear anymore what these refer to". Assertions below
# therefore check WHICH provider a fact belongs to (heading order, gutter
# absence on headings, shallower heading indentation, per-block nonce
# isolation for Behavior 7), not merely that fewer rows exist.
#
# THE ANTI-CHANGE this package's spec identifies (t/40 AC-17, t/41 AC7):
# those two blocks assert Dashboard::_fixed_panels(...) directly, which is a
# FROZEN, deliberately-retained legacy builder (D3) that still says
# 'Token'/'Spend' and is NOT part of the render path (Dashboard::compose_frame
# delegates entirely to tui::DashboardScreen::compose). This file never
# calls Dashboard::_fixed_panels/_run_lines/_token_lines/_spend_lines, and
# adds its OWN check (below) that their doc comments say so explicitly.
#
# NON-VACUITY: every negative/absence assertion below is paired with either
# a counter-fixture that trips the same detector, or a positive twin proving
# the detector is not simply blind (house rule; this blueprint has hit the
# vacuity trap four times already).
