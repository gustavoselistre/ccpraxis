# 64 — ORACLE for package 02-design-tokens (blueprint
# unified-tui-design-system), specs/02-design-tokens-spec.md. Written BLIND to
# any Theme.pm implementation — directly from the spec's numbered behaviours
# (B-A1..B-H3) and acceptance criteria (AC-1..AC-20) — so this serves as an
# oracle, not an echo of whatever the implementer eventually writes. Do NOT
# weaken an assertion here to make a future implementation's life easier.
#
# TODAY'S EXPECTED STATE, recorded so a future reader is not surprised:
# Theme.pm does not exist yet. B-A1 fails and this file calls BAIL_OUT right
# after — "nothing else can mean anything" once the one module under test
# cannot load (spec §3-A). Everything that does NOT depend on Theme.pm is
# deliberately placed BEFORE that bail point so it still runs and reports
# honestly today: the surface-level emoji pending-adoption scan (§2.6.3), the
# statusline GENERATED-block guard's classification machinery including
# today's real-surface verdict (§2.7), a Dashboard.pm self-consistency sanity
# check, and assorted fixture self-tests. A static `use Theme ();` would abort
# compilation of this WHOLE file the moment Theme.pm is missing (BEGIN blocks
# run during compilation, before ANY runtime statement, regardless of where
# `use` sits textually) — which would make it impossible for the sections
# above to report honestly today. So the load is a guarded RUNTIME `require`
# instead: same substance (loadability via the "$Bin/../../scripts" @INC
# entry, spec §2.0 rule 5) but it lets everything above the load report first.
# Once package 02 lands Theme.pm, the bail stops firing and every section
# below it — B, C, D, F, and the Theme-dependent parts of A/E/G — starts
# running for real.
#
# NO SHAPE PINS (AC-19, Decision 15): no count/is_deeply over the FULL role
# set, glyph set, %EMOJI_PENDING, %PENDING_GLYPH_REGISTRATION,
# @GENERATED_SURFACES or _dash_glyph_table() anywhere below. Any
# is(scalar(...), N) with N > 2 is over a fixture THIS FILE built, and its
# description says "fixture". The two is_deeply(\@names_in_hash,
# \@sorted_roles, ...) calls in section G compare two LIVE outputs derived
# from the SAME current Theme::roles() call against each other (self-
# consistency between generated_block() and roles()) — not a hardcoded pin —
# so they stay green when a later package adds a role.
#
# CONTRAST FLOORS, NEVER EQUALITIES (ruling R3): every contrast assertion is
# cmp_ok($ratio, '>=', $floor, ...), so a later tweak that IMPROVES contrast
# can never turn this suite red.
#
# THE ACCENT FAMILY IS A BAND (AC-8): asserted via abs(lstar - $T) <= $E,
# never an exact L*.
#
# HARD CONSTRAINTS (AC-20, B-H3): this file spawns no process, opens no
# network connection, touches no container, needs no real terminal, and
# writes only under File::Temp::tempdir(CLEANUP => 1). It runs standalone via
# `perl <file>` — there is no `prove` on this host.

# with both BEL and ST terminators, C0 controls (incl. bare CR), DEL, C1
# controls, and zero-width/combining characters. Every case is checked on
# BOTH paint() arms: the coloured arm (the legitimate sgr()/reset() wrapper
# -- which DOES emit ESC -- is stripped first) and the unknown-role
# passthrough arm (no wrapper at all, so the whole string must be clean).
# Corpus values are plain byte strings throughout (ASCII bytes for controls,
# Encode::encode('UTF-8', ...) for the wide C1/zero-width/combining
# codepoints) so there is no ambiguity about decoded-vs-byte-string

# B-E14 -- THE WAIVER ABOVE IS SCOPED BY USE SITE, NOT ONLY BY TOKEN NAME.
#
# The block above waives the emoji rule for title.* because "title glyphs never
# render in a terminal". That is a claim about where the tokens are USED, but it
# was enforced only against how they are NAMED -- so nothing stopped a terminal
# surface from referencing one, and something did: tui::DashboardScreen's
# container_glyph mapped the HEADER's unreachable family to 'title.gone'
# (U+26A0), putting an emoji-block codepoint into the terminal header for every
# unreachable or unknown container. The suite was fully green throughout.
#
# The defect was the guard's shape, not the mapping alone. Fixing only the
# mapping would leave the same hole open for the next reuse, so the waiver's
# premise is now asserted rather than asserted-in-prose.
#
# TWO CHECKS, because either alone is escapable:
#
#   B-E14a  BEHAVIOURAL. For every container state the dashboard can present,
#           the HEADER surface's glyph token is never a title.* one. This is the
#           exact regression, caught at the function the renderer calls -- so it
#           holds however the table is spelled or restructured.
#
#   B-E14b  TEXTUAL. No sandbox script names a title.* token at all, except the
#           three files that legitimately form the window-title path: Theme.pm
#           declares them, Dashboard.pm builds the title, and
#           tui/DashboardScreen.pm holds the per-surface table whose 'title' row
#           is their only other home. This catches a reuse in a panel, the
#           statusline or a screen module -- surfaces B-E14a does not reach.
#
# The token list is DERIVED from Theme::glyphs(), not typed here, so adding a
# fifth title glyph extends both checks automatically.
#
# LIMITATION, stated rather than hidden: B-E14b strips whole-line comments only.
# A title.* token quoted in a TRAILING comment on a line of code, in a file
# outside the allowlist, would fail this check. That is a deliberate trade --
# the alternative is a comment-aware Perl parser -- and the fix in that case is
# to move the note to its own line.

    # 2026-08-07T20:40:59Z): the original claim here was "Theme::display_width delegates to
    # Dashboard::display_width". 06's mandate makes Dashboard delegate its OWN width core to
    # tui::Layout, and the driver ruled that merely repointing Theme.pm:395 at
    # `require tui::Layout;` would only trade a Theme<->Dashboard 2-cycle for a
    # Theme<->tui::Layout 2-cycle (tui::Layout does `use Theme;` at compile time for its glyph
    # table) -- not a DAG. So `Theme::display_width` is deleted OUTRIGHT, not repointed: it has
    # exactly one caller in the repository, this assertion. The CLAIM survives unchanged --
    # glyph-width measurement agrees across the width core -- its SUBJECT moves from
    # `Theme::display_width` (now gone) to `tui::Layout::display_width` measured directly
    # against each glyph's own declared width (which is itself Theme's declaration, so this
    # is still a real cross-check, not a tautology against Theme's own table).

# SCOPE, stated rather than hidden: this pins that no EXISTING role is
# removed or changed. It deliberately does not pin the full key set -- the
# file's standing NO SHAPE PINS rule (Decision 15) forbids that, because later
# packages legitimately add roles. The hazard an added role would bring (a new
# `class` silently skipping the B-C7 contrast floor) is closed separately by
# the no-unrecognised-class assertion that follows.
