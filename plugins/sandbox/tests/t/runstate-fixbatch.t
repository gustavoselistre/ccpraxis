# agent-telemetry 04-runstate-run-and-package-facts consolidated fix-batch:
# covers the two behavioural fixes that have no home in the existing
# immutable oracle (t/runstate-package-facts.t, which permits exactly one
# authorised edit -- AC35's expected 'step' value -- and no others):
#
#   * HIGH-2  -- _parse_next_action takes the LAST '## Next action' heading
#                in an append-only ledger, not the first (stale-instruction
#                defect: a real archived ledger with five headings rendered
#                a finished package as "dispatch step 3").
#   * MEDIUM-2 -- both _parse_pipeline and _parse_next_action tolerate a
#                '#'-at-column-0 line (e.g. a pasted shell comment) inside a
#                fenced code block without misreading it as the next
#                markdown heading and truncating the scan early.
#
# Same harness discipline as t/184: a missing/failing sub degrades to a
# clean per-assertion FAIL via probe_call/probe_list, never a spurious PASS
# and never a file-aborting die.
