# COUNTING FILES IN A DIRECTORY IS NOT A LIFECYCLE. Eight scripts write into
# runs/escalations/ and exactly ONE narrow path cleared them -- and only for a
# direct package reset. A package that simply finished, or a run that simply
# ended, left its question queued forever and the panel kept asking.
#
# THE FAILURE DIRECTIONS ARE NOT SYMMETRIC (done-criterion 4), and that shapes
# every assertion here. A decision wrongly KEPT is a panel that nags. A decision
# wrongly DROPPED is a human who is never asked. So the settle rule is
# conservative by construction, and PART 2 spends more assertions on the
# must-stay-live cases than on the must-settle ones.

# tree has in neither direction -- and it is the same technique statusline.pl
# uses for bp_continuity_active_dir, where AC-13 pins the parity rather than
# assuming it.
#
# WITHOUT THIS CHECK the duplication would be a latent bug rather than a
# design: one copy could start settling something the other keeps, and the
# panel and the sweep would disagree about what the operator still owes.
