# s05-responsive-layout: the two-column layout oracle for Dashboard.pm.
#
# This file is the IMMUTABLE ORACLE for blueprint sandbox-butler-overhaul,
# package s05-responsive-layout (spec 02-responsive-layout-spec.md, S2
# interfaces / S3 observable behaviors / S4 acceptance criteria). It is
# written BLIND to Dashboard.pm's implementation -- directly from the spec --
# so it can serve as an oracle rather than an echo of whatever the
# implementer eventually writes.
#
# Coverage: AC-1..AC-13, AC-15, AC-17, AC-18. (AC-14 and AC-16 are
# suite/file-level criteria verified by the coordinator running the whole
# t/25 + t/39 + t/40 suite -- not exercised as unit assertions here.)
#
# The six new subs under test (_two_col_min_cols, _two_col_mode,
# _col_widths, _panel_rows, _join_cells, _two_col_rows) and the modified
# _body_rows/activity_capacity DO NOT YET EXIST/behave per-spec on package
# load -- most assertions below are EXPECTED to fail with "Undefined
# subroutine" (the file will very likely die at the very first call, per
# t/39's own precedent for s04) until the implementer lands s05. That is
# correct and by design; some later oracles (built on already-existing s04
# surfaces such as make_cell/compose_frame/activity_capacity) may instead
# fail with a WRONG VALUE rather than a die once those subs exist, which is
# an equally valid RED signal.
#
# Hard constraint (spec S4.6): this file MUST NOT `use utf8`. Glyph literals
# are written as "\x{...}" escapes (the decoded-character path), per s04 S8.

# $BP-1; a width chosen for an UNRELATED reason (an arbitrary "wide frame" or
# a maxh/row-height parameter, which this file also uses 99/100 for) STAYS

# '-' or a hardcoded codepoint -- so it cannot drift from Theme's own
# declaration. The TITLE LEAD-IN is now derived too: it was the ASCII "-- ",
# and is now one rule.h glyph plus a space, so the title line is continuous

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# AC-18 -> DC-2: odd widths. For $c in (101,121,201) at rows=24, every row is
# exactly $c display columns. UNRELATED to the breakpoint migration: these
# three values exercise ODD-width splitting, not the mode boundary -- all
# three remain comfortably above 90 (as they were above the old 100), so
# their role as "two-column, odd width" samples is unchanged. Stay literal.
#
# SUBJECT RE-POINTED (package 06, Family 1/AC-B4): "-- Sandbox " -> "-- Run "
# (the Sandbox panel is deleted, spec S2.4.3). The fixture gains a `tokens`
# hashref so a second lead panel (Token) exists to pair with Run and
# actually trigger the two-column split this AC probes (spec S2.4.3: the
# Token panel renders only when `ref $state->{tokens} eq 'HASH'`).
#
# RE-POINTED AGAIN (package t01-providers-panel, spec §6): Token is deleted;
# Blueprints is Run's new, unconditional pairing partner (Behavior 17), so
# the `tokens => {}` fixture augmentation is no longer needed to force a
# second lead panel into existence -- it exists regardless of input.
#
# THE "split point is int($c/2)" SUB-CLAIM IS RETIRED, REPORTED RATHER THAN
# INVENTED, driver ruling 2026-08-08 (ACCEPTED): measured directly against
# the real render path, it is FALSE under the new architecture. At c=201
# the Run title cell measured 67 display columns wide, not int(201/2)==100.
# The old claim assumed compose_frame's real two-column split used the same
# 50/50-ish rule as the legacy Dashboard::_col_widths helper (still
# independently, correctly tested by AC-2 above, unchanged) -- true under
# the OLD architecture because the old compose_frame literally called
# _col_widths internally. The NEW compose_frame delegates entirely to
# tui::DashboardScreen -> tui::Layout::place's own algorithm (package 05,
# plugins/sandbox/scripts/tui/Layout.pm -- out of this package's write set
# and spec S6 item 2 says "if one of them is wrong, escalate; do not patch
# it here"), which is free to allocate column widths by a different rule --
# 06's own spec never commits to a specific split ratio, only to
# arrangement (one column below the breakpoint, two at/above it -- spec
# S2.4.9).
#
# THE SURVIVING PROPERTY (driver ruling: what the 50/50 pin was a crude
# proxy for, and criterion 7's direct concern): whatever partition
# tui::Layout::place chooses, it must account for the FULL width exactly --
# nothing overflows past $c, no dead space is left unaccounted. Derived
# from place()'s OWN return value (never a hard-coded width like 67), then
# cross-checked against the REAL rendered row so this is an integration
# check, not a restatement of place()'s own arithmetic. Run/Token declare
# no min_cols (spec S2.4.3 gives that only to Resources/Spend), so two bare
# panel hashrefs are a faithful, minimal stand-in for what decides their
# partition.

    #   * the paired panels are Run|RESOURCES now, not Run|Blueprints -- the
    #     grid was reorganised so Resources sits beside Run and Blueprints spans
    #     the full width below Providers;
    #   * pairing is no longer implied by clearing tui::Layout's breakpoint.
    #     Resources declares min_cols 75 and Run 44, so a band holds both only
    #     once the MAIN region (terminal minus any side column) has ~119.
    #
    # 101 is therefore dropped from this loop and asserted as stacked below:
    # at 101 the main region is 101, which cannot hold 119. The odd widths that
    # remain are the ones where the pair genuinely fits, which is what keeps
    # AC-18's "odd widths still work" claim meaningful rather than vacuous.

# AC-11 -> DC-3: every row of spec S2.9's oracle table. RE-DERIVED (package
# 06, spec S5 ":756-774", Family 3): claim preserved verbatim -- "capacity is
# total rows minus the fixed region" -- but every literal expected NUMBER in
# the old table assumed the (now-deleted) Sandbox panel's fixed-region
# height AND the old 100-column breakpoint, BOTH of which moved the fixed
# region's size, so no literal survives unchanged. Per spec S5's own
# migration formula:
#   capacity == max(0, rows - 2(title+footer) - _fixed_region_height(state,cols) - 1)
# A live status alert is NOT folded into that formula (the spec's own worked
# example omits it); it is instead asserted as a DIFFERENTIAL against the
# non-alert derivation, preserving the ORIGINAL table's own comment ("a
# status alert costs one more row") as a relative claim rather than a
# guessed absolute term -- this also means the alert term cannot silently
# hide a bug inside _fixed_region_height itself. The backpack rows (T_2=4/6
# in the old comments) need NO special-casing any more: the backpack summary
# is now just one more row INSIDE the Run panel (spec S2.4.8), so
# _fixed_region_height(\%stb, $cols) already reflects it by construction.
# This derivation is anchored to real content by AC-12 below, which counts
# actually-rendered event rows against activity_capacity's return value --
# AC-11 alone would be a tautology-shaped restatement of the same formula
# activity_capacity itself presumably uses, but AC-12 is untouched by this
# migration and still cross-checks it against genuine rendered text.
