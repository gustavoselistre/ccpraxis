#!/usr/bin/env perl
# 67 — ORACLE for package 07 (blueprint
# unified-tui-design-system), specs/07-spec.md. Written BLIND
# to any tui/BackpackScreen.pm implementation -- it does not exist yet --
# directly from the spec's numbered observable behaviors (S3) and acceptance
# criteria (S4, AC-H/L/S/C/W/R/P). Do NOT weaken an assertion here to make a
# future implementation's life easier.
#
# TODAY'S EXPECTED STATE: plugins/sandbox/scripts/tui/BackpackScreen.pm does
# not exist yet. Every direct tui::BackpackScreen::* call below is gated on
# $BS_OK and SKIPs cleanly (not a fail, not a compile error) when it is
# false. Dashboard.pm, Theme.pm, BackpackApproval.pm and the tui/{Frame,
# Layout,Screen,DashboardScreen} modules ALREADY EXIST (shipped by earlier
# packages) and are called directly and unconditionally -- assertions against
# THOSE are expected to go RED TODAY for a WRONG VALUE (no 'b' branch in
# dispatch_key, no _assemble_esc sub, no backpack_screen seam wired into
# run(), no third/second \%err out-param on BackpackApproval::save/load)
# rather than a die, which is an equally valid RED signal.
#
# NON-VACUITY STRATEGY, applied uniformly (per this suite's established
# convention -- package 05's oracle shipped 423 assertions that could not
# fail; package 06's had two if-gated blocks that had never executed):
#   1. Count VALUE NONCES, never label words.
#   2. Every "== 1"/"== 0" count is preceded by a separately named "> 0"
#      liveness assertion.
#   3. Every negative assertion (unlike/no-row/absent) is paired with a
#      COUNTER-FIXTURE proving the SAME detector fires on a hand-built input
#      that SHOULD trip it.
#   4. Negatives are scoped to a VALUE (a span's role, a bounded token
#      extraction), never to a whole rendered line.
#   5. Decision 15 (no whole-shape pins) is enforced MECHANICALLY: AC-P8
#      greps this file's OWN source for `is(scalar(@` outside AC-R2's one
#      whitelisted frame-length identity, and for a whole-vocabulary
#      is_deeply.
#
# The module never touches the filesystem/process/clock/console (S2.0); this
# file therefore never needs launcher.pl, a container, or a real terminal --
# and AC-P7 below asserts, by scanning ITS OWN source, that it never gained
# one.

# ===========================================================================
# AC-S -- persistence through the existing seams (criterion 3)
# ===========================================================================

# _bp_run(%seams_with_keys) -> ($result, \@captured_frames). `keys` (an
# arrayref) drives read_key; `render` is overridden to CAPTURE the actual
# \@frame arrayref (not the bytes render() would normally produce) so a
# test can inspect roles/text directly without re-deriving them from ANSI
# bytes -- render's own contract (S2.4.1) is `->(\@prev|undef,\@frame) ->
# bytes`; nothing requires the coderef to actually MAKE bytes, only that it
# be a coderef, so this is a legitimate seam substitution, not a cheat.
#
# `wait_keys` (test-defect fix, MEDIUM-2/type-ahead-drain harness gap):
# an OPTIONAL second arrayref. Without it, `_bp_run` behaves exactly as
# before -- `read_key` alone, no `wait_key` seam, so an exhausted `keys`
# queue ends the loop via run()'s own "no input source at all" rule
# (S2.4.1: "a poll yields nothing and wait_key is not a coderef" ->
# terminate). That shape makes 'x' and a queued 'y' STRUCTURALLY
# ADJACENT -- both come off the same `read_key` queue with nothing between
# them -- which is indistinguishable from genuine type-ahead queued BEFORE
# the operator could have seen DROP_WARNING(), and run()'s post-arm drain
# (S2.4.1/MEDIUM-2) correctly eats it. That is not a harness bug; it is
# the harness correctly modelling the no-gap case (claim (b), see AC-C6
# below). To model a REAL gap -- a keystroke that arrives strictly AFTER
# the confirm has armed and the drain has already run its course, i.e. the
# operator saw the warning THEN pressed a key -- pass `wait_keys`: it
# becomes the `wait_key => ->($secs)` seam (S2.4.1's own "blocking-with-
# timeout" contract, "production always passes wait_key, so an idle
# dashboard modal never self-closes", spec line 289/301-303). The confirm-
# arm's drain only ever calls `read_key` directly (never `wait_key`), so a
# key supplied via `wait_keys` is NEVER visible to the drain -- it can only
# be observed by the *next* iteration of run()'s own loop, which is
# exactly "a later, separate keystroke" and nothing else. Bounded by
# max_ticks (default 50 once wait_keys is used, generous but finite) so an
# exhausted wait_keys queue (endless undef) cannot hang the test.
