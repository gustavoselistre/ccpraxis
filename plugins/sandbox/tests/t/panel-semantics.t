# This file is the IMMUTABLE ORACLE for blueprint sandbox-butler-overhaul,
# package s06 (spec 03-spec.md, S2 interfaces
# / S3 observable behaviors / S4 acceptance criteria). It is written BLIND to
# Dashboard.pm's implementation -- directly from the spec -- so it can serve
# as an oracle rather than an echo of whatever the implementer eventually
# writes.
#
# Coverage: AC1..AC28 (all of spec S4).
#
# The new subs under test (container_status_style, oauth_role, event_style,
# wrap_spans, _justify_spans, scroll_indicator, activity_row_width) and the
# changed-signature subs (_fixed_panels, build_panels, _backpack_lines,
# activity_window) DO NOT YET EXIST/behave per-spec on package load -- most
# assertions below are EXPECTED to fail with "Undefined subroutine" until the
# implementer lands s06. That is correct and by design.
#
# Hard constraint (spec S2, module contract): this file MUST NOT `use utf8`.
# Glyph literals are written as "\x{...}" escapes encoded to UTF-8 bytes via
# Encode::encode('UTF-8', ...), matching the module's own span-text contract.

# 4.3 Sandbox (DELETED) + Run panel spans + header (spec S3 behaviors 1-8):
# AC1, AC2, AC5, AC7, AC8
#
# CORRECTED for blueprint unified-tui-design-system package
# 06-dashboard-screen (in-scope oracle correction; driver adjudication
# packages/06-dashboard-screen.md 2026-08-08T00:37:32Z, RULINGS 2 and 3).
# Spec 06-dashboard-screen-spec.md S2.4.3: "The Sandbox panel is deleted."
# Its five rows are disposed of thus: project/container -> already in the
# header (S2.4.9: today's header content, unchanged); oauth -> the Token
# panel's `access` row when $state->{tokens} is a HASH, else the Run panel
# (S2.4.3's last conditional -- never both, never neither); heartbeat/
# uptime -> MOVE to Run, ahead of busy-lease/keep-awake/escalations (S2.4.3's
# stated Run body order). Per the standing rule ("an assertion may change
# its subject; it may never lose its claim"), every assertion below keeps
# ITS ORIGINAL CLAIM; only the panel/row/index it inspects moves. AC8
# (Run's busy-lease/keep-awake/escalations role table, immediately below AC7
# in this same block) is re-indexed for the same reason: heartbeat/uptime
# now sit ahead of it in Run, so leaving AC8's old indices [0,1,2] in place
# would silently assert the WRONG rows once the panel dissolves -- an
# adjacent defect this file must not ship even though AC8 itself was not
# separately named for re-pointing.
#
# The label gutter also unifies (S2.4.1, LABEL_GUTTER()==11): every panel's
# previous ad-hoc per-label literal ('project   : ', 'busy-lease : ', ...)
# disappears in favour of one sprintf('%-11s : ', label) gutter. Every
# label expectation below is therefore built via _live_gutter_label() (derived
# from tui::DashboardScreen::LABEL_GUTTER(), never hand-padded).
#
# TWO CLAIMS ARE INVERTED, NOT DROPPED (driver ruling, second round,
# 2026-08-08): the original absent-branch claims "project absent -> a
# visible '?' placeholder, role muted" and "container absent -> a visible
# '?' placeholder, role muted" (old lines 271-279) have no PLACEHOLDER
# analog -- the header's own absence handling (S2.4.9: "today's
# _title_line unchanged in content") OMITS the clause entirely (" -
# <project>" / "<container> " simply do not appear) rather than showing a
# "?". But what those two assertions actually bought was never the glyph
# "?" itself -- it was that THE ABSENT-PROJECT AND ABSENT-CONTAINER
# BRANCHES ARE EXERCISED, and the frame degrades in a defined,
# non-corrupting way. That purpose survives the design change intact, so
# the OLD SUBJECT (the deleted Sandbox panel's project/container rows,
# each rendering a "?" placeholder) becomes the NEW SUBJECT (the header,
# which renders a clean omission): the expected outcome inverts from
# "a '?' appears" to "the clause omits cleanly -- no dangling separator, no
# stray artifact, no literal undef, the frame still composes". Dropping
# these entirely would mean nobody exercises the absent-project path at
# all, which is exactly how a bare dangling " - ", a stray double space, or
# an interpolated "undef" ships unnoticed. Each inverted assertion below
# carries its own counter-fixture (the PRESENT case) so "the clause is
# absent" cannot pass vacuously against a header that never renders the
# clause under any input. The heartbeat/uptime absent-branch claims (still
# row-level facts inside Run) also survive and are re-pointed below.

# 06-dashboard-screen (in-scope oracle correction; driver adjudication
# packages/06-dashboard-screen.md 2026-08-08T00:37:32Z, RULING 3).
# recent_events gained an OPTIONAL 4th arg: Dashboard::recent_events
# ($lines, $n, $localtime_fn, $now). Per spec S2.4.6 step 4 the render
# stage now produces, in order: an optional TIME span -- emitted ONLY when
# $now is defined and numeric, text activity_time_text(fmt_duration($now -
# $epoch)), role 'text.muted' (a THEME role name -- a deliberately new
# span, distinct from the glyph/body spans below) -- then the GLYPH span,
# then the BODY span (both STILL deriving their role from
# Dashboard::event_style(...) exactly as before: that half of the claim is
# UNCHANGED, per the driver's explicit instruction to keep deriving
# glyph/role from event_style "as it already does"), then a COUNT span
# when count>=2. $localtime_fn (3rd arg, \&CORE::gmtime here) is retained
# for call-site compatibility and is UNUSED by the new time field (AC-F5:
# fmt_hms/_event_time are off the render path; the one duration grammar is
# fmt_duration, reachable here via the retained Dashboard::fmt_age alias,
# S2.4.7).
#
# The original assertions here pinned an ABSOLUTE "HH:MM:SS" first span
# with legacy role 'muted', produced by calling recent_events with NO
# $now (3 args only). That subject no longer exists: with $now undef, NO
# time span renders at all (S2.4.6 "Degradation when $now is absent" /
# S5), so a bare 3-arg call's first span is now the GLYPH span, not a
# timestamp. The CLAIM ("the timestamp is muted even though the event
# itself is good/bad", "the row carries glyph + type + extra, with the
# classified glyph") is preserved; its SUBJECT moves from an absolute
# clock time to a $now-relative duration, observed by injecting $now as a
# 4th argument (determinism: the clock is ALWAYS an argument, never
# time() -- same principle t/25's A1-A3 assert for compose_frame).
#
# A NEW arm is added (not in the original 8 reds, but spec'd and untested
# here until now): the "honest absence" degradation -- with $now absent,
# NO time span is produced at all. This is the counter-fixture that proves
# the time-span detector above can also NOT fire; a detector that always
# fires is not a detector (binding rule: every detector needs a
# counter-fixture proving it can fire).
