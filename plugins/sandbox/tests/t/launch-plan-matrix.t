# 181 — the launch decision, driven through every state it can be in.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A GREP. t/180 asserts the SHAPE of the
# launcher source. That is worth having, but it cannot tell you what the
# launcher would DO in a given state — and the operator was right to object to
# being handed logic whose only real exercise was their next launch.
#
# The decision could not be executed before, because it was inline conditionals
# in a 5000-line script whose surrounding code builds images and starts
# containers. So it was extracted into decide_launch_plan(), which is pure: no
# podman, no I/O, no globals. This file drives it through all 4 (image ×
# container) states crossed with forced / stale / each operator answer, and
# checks the four outputs each time.
#
# THE CASE THE OPERATOR ASKED ABOUT (2026-09-07): "image missing → Continue —
# will you try to build a base image of a newer version while trying to use the
# existing container of an older version?" The answer is yes, deliberately, and
# AC4 pins it with the reasoning: a container descending from a superseded
# image is the routine state after ANY rebuild (launcher.pl:2903 says so), and
# the launch gate aborts with 'image missing' when an EXITED container has no
# image (:4882) — which is the normal between-sessions state. Skipping that
# build turns a recoverable sandbox into a failed launch.
#
# AC1  nothing is asked, and nothing rebuilt, when nothing is stale
# AC2  a forced reason never asks and always rebuilds
# AC3  each operator answer maps to the right plan
# AC4  a missing image is always built, including when a container exists
# AC5  the container is only removed when it exists AND a rebuild happens
# AC6  cancel decides nothing else
