# Oracle tests for s03, derived from
#   .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-butler-overhaul/specs/s03-spec.md
#
# IMMUTABLE ORACLE: written from the spec BEFORE the implementation exists.
# launcher.pl does not yet carry the s03:health-detect sentinel region at
# authoring time -- large parts of this file are EXPECTED to show "not ok"
# until s03 lands. Do not weaken these assertions to make a future
# implementation's life easier.
#
# THE BUG (verified from source, s03 spec S0):
#   :3031  my $start_rc = system($PODMAN, 'start', $CONTAINER_NAME);
#   :3040  if ($start_rc != 0 && $port_in_use->($start_rc)) {   # ONLY the port case
#              ... every branch inside exits ...
#          }
#   :3098  log_ev('container_start', { exit => $start_rc >> 8, ... });   # falls through
# A non-port start failure satisfies neither arm, reaches log_ev (which
# faithfully records it), and then falls through into the exec chain against
# a container that never started. Logged but not aborted.
#
# THE SEAM (s12, done): `recover_container` at launcher.pl, documented as
# "the [l] relaunch/recover sequence, and the shared recovery seam the
# ledger promises s03 (which will call it at launch time with
# reason => 'launch-detect-broken')". s03 must INVOKE it, never reimplement
# recovery.
#
# WHY A SENTINEL + EVAL HARNESS (same technique as t/53's AC-10/AC-11, itself
# following q03's precedent): launcher.pl is NEVER require'd/do'ne in this
# suite -- it is a top-level script with real side effects (locks, podman
# invocations, terminal state), so behavioural assertions about a region that
# does not exist yet cannot be made by requiring the file. Instead, this
# oracle PRESCRIBES the interface s03 must build: a self-contained, pure,
# seam-driven region between two sentinel comments that this file extracts
# as source text and evals into a throwaway package. That region must define
# exactly one sub, `s03_run_launch_gate(%seams)`, whose seven seam callbacks
# (documented below at CONTRACT) let this file drive every branch with fakes
# and NO real podman/system/subprocess anywhere.
#
# CONTRACT (s03 must implement this to turn this file green):
#   Sentinels (each occurs exactly once, BEGIN before END):
#     # >>> s03:health-detect:BEGIN
#     # <<< s03:health-detect:END
#   Region defines exactly one sub: s03_run_launch_gate(%seams) -> \%result
#   Required seam keys (all called, none reimplemented inline):
#     probe()               -> \%state { machine_ok, container_state,
#                                         image_present, exec_probe_ok }
#     start()                -> $start_rc (integer, models `podman start`)
#     is_port_failure($rc)   -> bool (models the existing $port_in_use check)
#     recover($reason)       -> invoked for a rebuild offer; production binds
#                                this to recover_container(reason => $reason)
#     abort($rc)             -> invoked for a clean non-port-failure abort;
#                                production binds this to the existing
#                                "print STDERR ...; exit(...)" idiom
#     exec()                 -> invoked only when nothing aborted/recovered;
#                                production binds this to the podman exec
#                                touch-sentinel chain
#   Logic (this is the fix, prescribed so it is independently checkable):
#     1. state = probe(); if !state.machine_ok -> return diagnosis
#        'podman machine/socket unreachable', no recover, no abort, no exec.
#     2. if state.container_state eq 'exited' && !state.image_present ->
#        recover('launch-detect-broken'); return diagnosis 'image missing',
#        no exec.
#     3. if state.container_state eq 'running' && !state.exec_probe_ok ->
#        recover('launch-detect-broken'); return diagnosis 'degraded exec
#        environment', no exec.
#     4. otherwise: start_rc = start(); if start_rc != 0: if
#        is_port_failure(start_rc) -> return delegated_port => 1 (let the
#        EXISTING, untouched port-collision code at :3040-3097 handle it --
#        C6, no regression); else -> abort(start_rc); return aborted => 1,
#        exec NOT called. if start_rc == 0 -> exec(); return exec_called=>1.
#
# Region purity (mirrors q03's R-I2): the extracted text must reference no
# $PODMAN, no system(/backtick, no literal exit(, and must not itself shell
# out to podman -- every effect must go through the seven seams above. This
# is how C5 ("no duplicated recovery logic") is checked structurally: nothing
# in the region can be a second rebuild path.
#
# No real podman/container anywhere in this file. No SKIP whose condition is
# the failure state -- absence is recorded as ok(0, ...) with a diagnostic,
# same ruling as t/53.
