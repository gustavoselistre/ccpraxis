# 88 -- ORACLE for package d02-wrap-every-surface
# (blueprint ccpraxis-tooling-debt), specs/d02-wrap-every-surface-spec.md.
# Written BLIND to any implementation of the banner-wrap fix -- Screen.pm's
# banner block still routes through tui::Frame::make_cell (truncate) as of
# this writing. Do NOT weaken an assertion here to make a future
# implementation's life easier.
#
# TODAY'S EXPECTED STATE: banners truncate, not wrap. Every assertion below
# that depends on wrapping is expected to go RED for a WRONG VALUE (a single
# truncated cell, or a dropped "[d] dismiss" hint) -- that IS "missing
# behavior", not a harness bug. Title/footer assertions (which pin the
# UNCHANGED, deliberately-truncating behavior, spec Decision D1) are expected
# to be GREEN today and must stay green after implementation.
#
# This file complements, and does not duplicate, the amendment made to
# t/wrap-on-overflow.t:543-575 (the single superseded assertion) and the
# DashboardScreen.pm addition to t/75's AC7 non-ASCII guard. See this
# package's test-writer report for the full criterion map.
#
# SELECTOR NOTE (read before editing): several blocks below select "the
# banner row(s)" out of a composed frame by CELL ROLE rather than by a text
# substring. This deliberately differs from t/75's own (amended) exclusion
# block, which still uses a text-substring grep per the spec's literal
# wording. Role-based selection was required here because this file's own
# fixtures reuse words across title/footer/banner text (to keep fixtures
# short), which a substring grep cannot disambiguate; role is unambiguous
# because tui::Screen::compose emits a distinct, stable role per surface
# (title default 'accent', footer default 'text.faint', panel/body default
# 'text.primary', banner default 'state.warn' via Screen.pm's own
# _ROLE_ATTENTION(), or an explicit caller-supplied banner_role such as
# DashboardScreen's 'state.crit'). This is a black-box observable of
# compose()'s public contract, not a reach into a private implementation
# detail.
