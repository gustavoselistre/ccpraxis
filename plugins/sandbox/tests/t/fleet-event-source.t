# s16: butler fleet + keep-awake events into the activity panel.
#
# This file is the IMMUTABLE ORACLE for blueprint sandbox-butler-overhaul,
# package s16 (specs/s16-spec.md). It is
# written BLIND to any launcher.pl / LaunchLog.pm / Dashboard.pm / KeepAwake.pm
# implementation -- directly from the spec -- so it serves as an oracle rather
# than an echo of whatever the implementer eventually writes. Do NOT weaken an
# assertion to make a future implementation's life easier.
#
# Coverage: C1..C9 (spec S5).
#
# HARD CONSTRAINTS honoured here (spec S5 preamble):
#   * PURE/structural: never spawns launcher.pl, never builds an image, never
#     starts a container. launcher.pl is SLURPED for source-text assertions
#     only (t/48's established convention) -- never require'd/do'ne.
#   * Fixtures live only under File::Temp tempdir()s.
#
# PINNED INTERFACE (spec S1.1). Two symbols this package introduces are named
# in the spec so the oracle and the implementer agree rather than negotiating
# through failures:
#
#   LaunchLog::merge_by_key($sources, key => $coderef, max => $n) -> \@merged
#       The cross-source interleave. NEVER inspects an item itself -- the
#       caller's `key` coderef does, so s13's opacity guarantee survives.
#       `key` is REQUIRED: defaulting it would let a caller silently get
#       append-order-only merging while believing it was time-ordered.
#       STABLE -- equal keys, undef keys and apparent clock skew all preserve
#       each source's own relative order.
#
#   KeepAwake->new(..., on_event => sub { my (%event) = @_; ... })
#       The emit seam, matching KeepAwake's existing start/stop injection
#       style. Fires ONLY on a state transition.
#
# An earlier draft of this file GUESSED both -- eight candidate sub names under
# two calling conventions, and four candidate constructor keys. That is a
# latent false negative (an implementer who picks a ninth name has a correct
# implementation that reads as broken) and, worse, it invites name-matching
# instead of design. The spec was amended to pin them; this file asserts the
# pinned names only.
