#
# Skills are reconciled with the EXISTING, already-tested
# PluginSync::reconcile_copy_plan — spec.md §2.1/§2.2 deliberately reuse it
# unmodified rather than write a second reconcile. What's new is only the
# SHAPE of the entries: skill-shaped plan entries never carry a `src` key
# (skills are never copied, only ever bind-mounted live). This file exercises
# reconcile_copy_plan directly with that skill shape, so it is testing
# BEHAVIOR (does a src-less entry get removed/kept/never-copied correctly),
# not re-testing plugin-copy behavior already covered by t/plugin-sync.t.
#
# reconcile_copy_plan itself is fully implemented today (confirmed by reading
# PluginSync.pm during authoring: line 187's `next unless defined $e->{src}`
# already gates copying on src being present). So most assertions here are
# expected to ALREADY PASS — they are regression locks proving the reused
# function is safe for the new skill use-case, per spec.md's explicit
# instruction that AC-4/AC-5/AC-8a be testable via reconcile_copy_plan
# directly. Anything that fails indicates PluginSync.pm's contract is NOT
# what spec.md §2.1 assumes it is — a real, actionable finding either way.

# that loop body never runs at all. This is distinct from AC-8a above (which

# moment where $prior is deliberately [] because no manifest has been written
# yet, even though the directory MIGHT independently reappear in a later
# $prior once manifests start being written.
