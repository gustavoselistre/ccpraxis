# 01-execution-power-request (host-wake-and-suspend blueprint).
#
# keep-awake.ps1 currently holds SetThreadExecutionState(ES_CONTINUOUS |
# ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED) which produces DISPLAY/SYSTEM rows in `powercfg
# /requests` but leaves EXECUTION: None. This package adds a real Win32
# Power Request (PowerCreateRequest/PowerSetRequest/PowerClearRequest via
# P/Invoke) acquired right after the existing SetThreadExecutionState call
# succeeds and released from the existing `finally` block.
#
# No test in this repo previously exercised a .ps1 file's Add-Type/P-Invoke
# path (scout-confirmed) -- this is the first. Chosen approach (spec section
# 5): spawn the REAL script as a real child process and assert on its
# -LogFile output; no mocking of Win32 APIs. Creating/setting/clearing a
# power request for the calling process needs no elevation (only reading
# ALL holders via `powercfg /requests` does) -- so the happy path and the
# degrade path (forced via -SimulatePowerRequestFailure, a test-only seam)
# are both safely exercisable unattended. Only AC7 (elevated `powercfg
# /requests` observation, Decision 8) is explicitly manual -- see spec
# section 6. Not tested here by design.
#
# Cleanup discipline: every spawned keep-awake.ps1's WINPID (the real
# Windows pid it writes about itself into -PidFile -- NOT any pid Perl's
# open() tracked; see this project's CLAUDE.md on the MSYS-pid/WINPID
# landmine) is registered in @LIVE_WINPIDS the moment it is known. An END
# block force-kills anything still alive there, on top of the per-test
# force_kill_if_alive() backstop, so a failed run can never leave a real
# wake-lock holder running on this machine.
