# THE BUSY-LEASE PROBE MUST SURVIVE MSYS2 PATH CONVERSION.
#
# Measured defect, 2026-09-16, reported as 20260915-230820-d33e. The container
# sampler cleared MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL at startup -- copied from the resources
# and spend samplers, which clear it for good reason -- and then ran
#
#     podman exec <ctr> stat -c %Y /tmp/.butler-busy
#
# podman.exe is a NATIVE Windows binary, so MSYS2 rewrote that leading-slash
# argument on the way in. What the container actually saw was the HOST's temp
# directory:
#
#     stat: cannot statx 'C:/Users/ANDR~1/AppData/Local/Temp/.butler-busy':
#           No such file or directory
#
# _busy_lease_probe matched "no such file" and returned 'lease-absent' -- which
# asserts a fact about the CONTAINER, and which KeepAwake::on_probe releases the
# wake-lock for at once, with none of the tolerance it applies to 'probe-failed'.
# The lease was in fact being refreshed every 2-10 seconds throughout. The host
# slept under a live blueprint fleet; the launch log for that sixteen-hour
# session contains 503 heartbeats and ZERO keepawake events, because the lock
# was never taken out at all.
#
# Broken in efdd028 (2026-08-25), when the four podman calls moved off the
# render tick into the sampler. Three weeks, every sandbox, every fleet run.
#
# WHAT THIS FILE GUARDS, in the order the defect has to get through:
#   A. the command SHAPE -- no podman exec anywhere may hand a native binary a
#      bare leading-slash path; `sh -c '...'` is correct under either
#      conversion state and cannot be broken by a caller's environment.
#   B. the sampler's ENVIRONMENT -- it must keep the opt-out, not clear it.
#   C. the CLASSIFICATION -- even if both of the above are defeated, a stat
#      failure naming a path we did not ask for is 'probe-failed', never
#      'lease-absent'.
#   D. the DECISION -- that distinction must actually change what on_probe does
#      to the wake-lock, which is the only reason any of it matters.
#
# Structural for A and B (launcher.pl is a script, slurped for source-text
# assertions -- the convention container-sampler.t established); behavioural for
# C and D against the real module.
