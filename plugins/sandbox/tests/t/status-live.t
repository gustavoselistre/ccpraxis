# s07-live-status: spinner + status colour + OS window title.
#
# This file is the IMMUTABLE ORACLE for blueprint sandbox-butler-overhaul,
# package s07-live-status (spec 04-live-status-spec.md, S2 interfaces / S3
# observable behaviours / S4 acceptance criteria). It is written BLIND to
# Dashboard.pm/launcher.pl's implementation -- directly from the spec -- so
# it can serve as an oracle rather than an echo of whatever the implementer
# eventually writes.
#
# Coverage: AC-1 .. AC-12, AC-14 (AC-13 is the whole-suite gate, verified by
# the coordinator running run-tests.pl separately -- not a unit assertion
# here).
#
# The two new subs under test (Dashboard::spinner_frame, Dashboard::
# window_title) and the loop wiring (wall-clock spinner_idx, OSC emission in
# Dashboard::run, launcher.pl's enter_raw/leave_raw title save+restore) DO
# NOT YET EXIST / behave per-spec on package load -- most assertions below
# are EXPECTED to fail with "Undefined subroutine" or a wrong-value mismatch
# until the implementer lands s07. That is correct and by design.
#
# Hard constraint (mirrors t/39 S8 / t/40 S4.6): this file MUST NOT `use
# utf8`. Glyph literals are written as "\x{...}" escapes (the decoded-
# character path) or via Encode::encode (the UTF-8-byte path), per the
# spec's own S2.1 code block.

# tui::DashboardScreen::_container_role (the header) and

# libpod/define/containerstate.go, whose String() values are:
#
#   created initialized running stopped paused exited stopping removing unknown
#
# The failure mode was silent and asymmetric: a container created in the OCI
# runtime but not started rendered as a transitional state in one place and as
# "unrecognised" in the other. So this pins the SET, and pins that the two
# classifiers AGREE -- the duplication is the hazard, so agreement is the thing
# asserted rather than either list's contents.
