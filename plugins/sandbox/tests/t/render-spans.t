# s04-render-foundation: the render/span oracle for Dashboard.pm.
#
# This file is the IMMUTABLE ORACLE for blueprint s04-render-foundation
# (spec 01-render-foundation-spec.md, S3 API contract / S5 invariants /
# S7 acceptance criteria). It is written BLIND to Dashboard.pm's
# implementation -- directly from the spec -- so it can serve as an oracle
# rather than an echo of whatever the implementer eventually writes.
#
# Coverage: AC-1..AC-7, AC-10 (multi-span variant), AC-11 (role-only and
# span-only variants), AC-13 (multi-span), AC-14, AC-15, AC-16, AC-18, AC-19.
#
# The functions under test (display_width, glyph_table, glyph_width, _safe,
# spanify, spans_width, spans_text, fit_spans, make_cell, sgr_for_role,
# _row_ansi, render_frame) DO NOT YET EXIST on package load -- every
# assertion below is EXPECTED to fail with "Undefined subroutine" until the
# implementer lands s04. That is correct and by design.
#
# Hard constraint (S3, D7): this file MUST NOT `use utf8`. Glyph literals are
# written as "\x{...}" escapes / chr($codepoint) (the decoded-character path)
# and mirrored via Encode::encode('UTF-8', ...) (the UTF-8-byte path) so both
# of D3's encoding paths are exercised without flagging this source file as
# UTF-8 itself.

# Fixture: the pinned glyph table (spec S3.2) -- codepoint, expected column
# width, group, human name. Shared by AC-2 and AC-15.
#
# MIGRATED 2026-08-08 (package 06-dashboard-screen, driver scope grant E-B):
# the four status-circle EMOJI (U+1F7E2/1F534/1F7E1/26AA) that used to sit
# here at width 2 are REMOVED from this fixture, not re-pinned at a new
# width. Obligation 3 (spec 06 S2.2) deletes them from Dashboard's glyph
# table entirely -- Theme.pm never declared them (they are emoji; Decision
# 11 forbids emoji in this design system) and _dash_glyph_table() now
# derives from Theme::glyphs() instead of its own legacy %GLYPH_TABLE. They
# are no longer "pinned glyphs" at all, so a row here claiming "this is a
# pinned glyph at width W" would be false of them regardless of W. Their
# AC-2/AC-15 claims are RETARGETED, not dropped -- see the "RETIRED FROM
# AC-2/AC-15" block right after AC-15 below, which proves the new, correct
# behaviour (unlisted: absent from glyph_table(), glyph_width() undef,
# _safe() -> '?') for these exact four codepoints.
# ===========================================================================
# THE SPINNER FRAMES ARE DERIVED, not pasted (re-pointed 2026-08-25). The
# sequence changed from ten frames with uneven dot counts to eight uniform ones,
# and a pasted list of codepoints turns a deliberate re-styling into a red test
# about characters this file never claimed were special. What AC-2 and AC-15 are
# about is the WIDTH CONTRACT -- every glyph the renderer emits is declared, at
# its declared width, and measures the same decoded or as UTF-8 bytes -- and
# that claim is exactly as strong over whatever frames Theme declares. The dot
# count itself is pinned where it belongs, in t/status-live.t's UNIFORM DOTS

# RETARGETED by s06-panel-semantics (2026-07-28): the exact-span-count
# assertion below now expects the 6-span per-field shape (indent, label,
# value, gap, glyph+status, trailing pad) that s06's own done-criterion #1
# mandates for this same container line — see t/panel-semantics.t AC1/AC5
# for the superseding, per-field oracle. Every other assertion in this block
# (row role, indent span, spans_text invariant, no-ESC invariant) still holds
# unchanged and is untouched.
#
# RE-RETARGETED 2026-08-08 (package 06-dashboard-screen, driver scope grant
# E-B/E-D; precedent: the driver's own Ruling 2 for the structurally
# identical case in t/41's AC5, "composed container line -> the header
# row"). Package 06 deletes the Sandbox panel outright (spec 06 S2.4.3):
# "container" is no longer a panel body row at all -- it is header material
# ("<container> [<status>]", right-justified). There is therefore no
# "container : claude-demo..." body row left to find. The SAME move the
# driver ruled for t/41's AC5 is applied here:
#   (a) "the container fact reaches the frame" -> now asserted against the
#       HEADER row (frame->[0]{text}), not a panel body row. Claim held.
#   (b) the structural regression checks this block also made (row role,
#       2-space indent span, spans_text invariant, no-ESC invariant) are
#       properties of ANY row()-composed panel body row, not specifically
#       of "container" -- re-pointed onto the Run panel's "heartbeat" row
#       (spec 06 S2.4.3's Run-panel row list: "heartbeat, uptime,
#       busy-lease, ..."), a row this design still produces. Role literal
#       'body' moves to 'text.primary' per spec 06 S2.1's mapping table
#       ("panel-title, value, strong, body, blank -> text.primary"),
#       confirmed against tui::Screen.pm's _render_panel (a read-only,
#       spec-named module, tui/Screen.pm:77-91): an ordinary panel line
#       defaults to cell role 'text.primary', with a leading 2-space indent
#       span also of role 'text.primary'.
#   (c) the EXACT 6-span shape ("indent, label, value, gap, glyph+status,
#       pad") was itself specific to the OLD bespoke Sandbox container-row
#       builder, deleted along with the panel -- it cannot be re-derived
#       without inventing an implementation detail this spec does not
#       state, and this file's own prior comment already treats the exact
#       shape as t/panel-semantics.t's claim to keep ("the superseding,
#       per-field oracle"), not this file's. RETIRED here, not silently
#       dropped: replaced with a floor (>= 2 spans: the indent plus at
#       least one content span), which is the one shape fact spec 06
#       S2.4.9's row() genuinely guarantees. Decision 15 (no whole-shape
#       pins) independently disfavours re-pinning an exact count anyway.
