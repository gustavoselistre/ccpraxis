# Two operator complaints about the dashboard, which turned out to be ONE
# defect seen twice:
#
#   "the overall layout is a piece of shit. Look at all the empty space"
#   "when the dashboard TUI appeared it first was a complete mess with
#    characters jumping around and it took many seconds until it actually
#    settled into the final layout"
#
# Every panel rendered at its NATURAL content height and the leftover body
# height became blank padding at the bottom. That single decision produces both:
# a 55-row terminal drew ~15 rows of content and ~35 rows of nothing, AND every
# panel's position depended on how much content the panels above it happened to
# have -- so while the activity log was being actively written during the first
# seconds of a launch, the whole frame reflowed on each arriving event.
#
# The fix is tui::Screen's flex band (H6): one panel absorbs the leftover rows,
# so the space is used AND the geometry stops tracking content. This file pins
# both halves, plus the two ways it could go wrong: the flex panel being
# squeezed out entirely on a short terminal, and panels that appear mid-session
# (the detached resources sampler) re-introducing the reflow.

# Providers (t01-providers-panel's successor to Spend, whose snapshot is never
# written at all today), and for Blueprints (t01's new sibling panel for the
# blueprint-run list, unconditional for the identical reason -- D4).
#
# RETARGETED (package t01-providers-panel, spec §6): the panel title `Spend`
# no longer exists -- its direct successor `Providers` is the claim's new
# subject, the CLAIM ITSELF ("the panel exists before any snapshot is read")
# is unchanged. `Blueprints` is an ADDITION (recommended by spec §6, not a
# correction) closing the gap this package opens: it is now equally
# unconditional (D4) and this is exactly the oracle that would catch a
# future regression reintroducing a conditional panel.
