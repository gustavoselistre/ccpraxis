# The assumption is right; the boundary is sharper than module-vs-launcher. It

# the require failed, long after the damage.

# ROOT CAUSE OF TWO SYMPTOMS THAT LOOKED UNRELATED. bin/claude-sandbox.ps1
# invokes the launcher with a Windows path and sets MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL='*' for
# the whole process tree, so nothing downstream translates it. $SELF_PL was
# therefore `C:/Users/.../launcher.pl`, and every consumer hands it to MSYS
# perl. The child resolved it RELATIVE TO ITS CWD -- measured, from the
# operator's own screen once the sampler began reporting its reason:
#
#   Can't open perl script
#     "/c/Development/indocs/indocs-bacen-scraper/C:/Users/Andre/.claude/..."
#
# That is the project path with the Windows path appended. It killed BOTH
# samplers at exec on every launch (which is why neither ever wrote a pidfile,
# almanac 20260824-203404-77e1) and mangled the hot-reload gate's -I, so every
# candidate module failed to locate Theme.pm and was reported as "does not
# compile".

# AC20 -- the compile gate PRE-FLIGHTS the library path, and names the remedy.
#
# Every render module `use`s Theme, so a bad -I makes ALL of them fail with
# "Can't locate Theme.pm in @INC" plus a path dump -- true, unactionable, and
# indistinguishable from a genuine syntax error inside Theme itself.
#
# Observed live on 2026-08-25 (project indocs-bacen-scraper, launcher up 9h28m):
# five modules refused at once, the @INC dump reading
# `/c/Development/indocs/indocs-bacen-scraper/C`, i.e. a `C:/Users/...` path
# joined onto the working directory. One cause: a launcher started BEFORE the
# $0 normalisation fix, where abs_path() ran ahead of the backslash
# translation so Cygwin took the drive-letter path as relative.
#
# The cruel part is that pressing [r] can NEVER fix it -- the fault is in the
# running launcher.pl, which is precisely what hot reload cannot replace, and
# the restart path compiles through this same gate. Only a relaunch works. So
# the gate must SAY that rather than dumping @INC.
