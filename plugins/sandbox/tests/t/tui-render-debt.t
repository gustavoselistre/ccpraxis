# 89 -- ORACLE for package t08 (blueprint
# tui-operator-feedback), specs/t08-spec.md. Written BLIND to
# any implementation of the three fixes (c8b0/59a4/9897) -- straight from the
# spec's numbered observable behaviors (S"Observable behaviors" 1-17) and
# acceptance criteria (AC1-16, minus AC6/AC16 which the spec itself rules
# report-only and unverifiable in-process -- see this package's final report
# for those two). Do NOT weaken an assertion here to make a future
# implementation's life easier.
#
# TODAY'S EXPECTED STATE (measured against the clone before this package's
# edit):
#   - Dashboard::render_frame's $full formula still ORs in $opts->{full}
#     (Dashboard.pm:2103) -- dead code, zero call sites, but still present
#     as a literal token in the source (AC5/behavior 6 below is RED today).
#   - Dashboard::run's loop never tracks last-seen (cols,rows) -- a
#     width-only resize at the next periodic poll produces NO \e[2J\e[H in
#     the next frame (AC1/behavior 1 below is RED today; the per-row diff
#     touches every row instead, per t/dashboard-framework.t:795-800's own pin).
#   - tui::Frame::bound_for_wrap does not exist at all -- every direct call
#     below is wrapped in eval and expected to die ("Undefined subroutine"),
#     reported explicitly (AC7/AC8/AC9 below are RED today for a die, not a
#     wrong value).
#   - tui::Screen::compose()'s banner loop still wraps the FULL message
#     before slicing to budget -- unbounded, so behavior 12's timing
#     assertion is RED today (measured ~10.5s for a 100,000-char single
#     token at cols=1 on this host, vs. the well-under-5s target).
#   - The "[d] dismiss" hint can still land split across a wrap boundary at
#     cols=40 for a shaped-to-trigger fixture (AC11/behavior 14 below is RED
#     today for exactly that reason).
#   - _banner_lines (AC10/behavior 13), the row-budget invariant
#     (AC12/behavior 15), the multi-char-bracket-word control
#     (AC13/behavior 16) and the wrap_line fast path (AC14/behavior 17) are
#     all ALREADY GREEN today and must stay green -- regression guards, not
#     missing-behavior probes.
#
# NON-VACUITY: every "does not happen" assertion (no \e[2J, no split) is
# paired with a fixture hand-tuned (via direct experimentation against this
# clone) to actually trigger the failure mode today, not a fixture that
# happens to dodge it by luck.

# repaint to trigger or it may not even trigger at all. But the moment I e.g.
# scroll my mouse, everything repaints nicely."
#
# The cause: term_size() was polled INSIDE run()'s state-refresh block, so a
# resize could not be noticed until the next gather round -- $state_int (2s in
# production) plus however long the gather itself took. Scrolling papered over
# it because $activity_offset is in the frame-cache signature.
#
# This case pins the fix where PART 1 cannot: state_interval is set so large
# that NO second gather happens during the run. Every frame after the first is
# therefore attributable to geometry alone. Under the old code term_size() was
# called exactly once and the resize was never seen at all.

# PART 11 -- REGRESSION, added by the driver 2026-08-19 after this package's
# red-team found a CRITICAL that THIS FILE passed straight through.
#
# bound_for_wrap under-cut and silently dropped real banner content whenever
# $cols <= WRAP_CONTINUATION_INDENT, because wrap_line's degenerate
# content_w == $w fallback removes the slack the old $max_rows * $w limit
# accidentally relied on. Every one of the six literal install-warning strings
# diverged from the unbounded wrap at cols 1 and 2; the driver reproduced 48
# diverging combinations out of 96.
#
# WHY THIS FILE MISSED IT, which is the part worth pinning: AC8's content
# check hardcodes cols=40, and the only cols=1 check (AC9/behavior 12) uses a
# single unbreakable token and asserts timing rather than content. The two
# never overlapped on the vulnerable shape -- word-separated text at a
# degenerate width -- so 47/47 was green over a live bug. The invariant below
# is stated directly instead: for ANY text, width and row budget, bounding
# then wrapping must produce the same surviving rows as wrapping unbounded.
# That is the whole contract of the bound; it exists to skip work, never to
# change what the operator sees.
