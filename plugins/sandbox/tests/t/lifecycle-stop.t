# This file is the IMMUTABLE ORACLE for blueprint sandbox-butler-overhaul,
# package s11 (specs/08-spec.md). It is written
# BLIND to any Dashboard.pm / launcher.pl implementation -- directly from the
# spec -- so it can serve as an oracle rather than an echo of whatever the
# implementer eventually writes. Do NOT weaken an assertion to make a future
# implementation's life easier.
#
# Coverage: AC-1..AC-21 (spec S4). AC-22 (whole-suite-green gate) is a
# coordinator-side check, not encoded here (same convention as t/45's AC-27).
#
# Hard constraints honoured here:
#   * NO real podman: every container/machine interaction goes through an
#     injected seam fake (build_seams(), below). No system/qx/backtick/exec
#     against podman anywhere in this file.
#   * NO real sleeping: await_quiet and run_stages are driven with injected
#     now/sleep_for fakes throughout; build_seams()'s default now/sleep_for
#     is itself a fake incrementing clock (never real wall-clock time), so
#     even a "never quiet" probe cannot cause a real wait.
#   * launcher.pl is NEVER require'd/do'ne for AC-21 -- source-text slurp +
#     regex only (t/36's stated convention, followed by t/43/t/44/t/45).

# anchoring to `/^!! /` (the reviewer's own suggested minimal fix) is WRONG
# (undercounts an unwrapped banner alongside a wrapped one), why the
# structural discriminator (first span's role) is authoritative, and the
# ruled width floor: banner-start COUNTING is undefined at $cols < 3
# (wrap_line's degenerate-budget path drops the leading-indent span
# entirely at 1-2 columns, so no discriminator -- structural or textual --
# can recover a count there), but IS still correct at $cols == 3 exactly
# via the structural check alone (driver-verified). All existing call sites
# in THIS file use $cols in (40, 80, 100, 200) -- comfortably clear of that
# floor -- so this file makes no cols<3 assertion of its own; the pinned
# width-floor coverage lives in t/25.

        # (specs/d02-wrap-every-surface-spec.md, Section 0): banners now wrap
        # instead of truncate, so "one row per banner" stopped being a valid
        # proxy for "how many banners are present" -- at cols=40 these two
        # banners occupy 5 rows, at cols=80 they occupy 3 (driver-verified
        # against tui::Screen::compose directly: total frame rows stayed
        # exactly $rows in every case, so nothing is lost, it is just spread
        # across more rows). The intent of the original assertion -- "the
        # lifecycle alert and the status alert both surface, distinct from
        # one another" -- is preserved by counting banner-START rows instead
        # of raw rows.
        # RE-AMENDED, fix-batch step 7 (reviewer MUST-FIX #1): the previous
        # unanchored `/!! /` text scan over-counts when a CONTINUATION row's
        # own wrapped content happens to contain "!! " -- see
        # count_banner_starts's doc comment (top of this file) for the full
        # derivation, including why the reviewer's own suggested anchored
        # `/^!! /` fix is ALSO wrong (undercounts a wrapped+unwrapped banner
        # pair). Use the structural discriminator instead.
        # RE-POINTED 2026-08-28: COUNT THE ALERTS, NOT THEIR ROWS.

        # count_banner_starts inferred "how many alerts" from rendered rows, by

        # continuation span's role. That inference does not survive the move to
        # an overlay: the overlay wraps with ONE role throughout, so every row
        # looks like a start and two alerts counted as three.
        #
        # The population is now enumerable directly --
        # tui::DashboardScreen::warning_entries is the single source the
        # renderer itself uses -- so the claim ("both alerts surface, distinct
