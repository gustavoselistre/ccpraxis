# t04 -- the oracle for blueprint tui-operator-feedback.
#
# Closes the operator's fifth report, verbatim: "the blueprints section should
# be styled as a table because right now its hard to see with things randomly
# aligned."
#
# It was literally that. _one_run_summary_spans concatenated variable-width
# fields with two-space separators, so the state of run 2 sat under the middle
# of run 1's name and nothing below the first field lined up with anything. A
# per-row renderer structurally CANNOT align columns -- only something that can
# see every row at once can.
#
# CRITERION 2 IS WHY THE HELPER LIVES IN tui::Frame: written once, reusable, not
# inlined into this one panel. The predecessor initiative spent two fix-batches
# on exactly this class of duplication, so PART 1 tests the helper on synthetic
# data with no dashboard in sight, and PART 3 tests the panel through it.
