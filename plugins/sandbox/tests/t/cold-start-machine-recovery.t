# Regression oracle: a STOPPED podman machine must not end the launch.
#
# THE OPERATOR'S REPORT (2026-08-14): "I am now trying to launch claude-sandbox
# and it just takes me to the TUI and then back to the console. Probably because
# the podman machine is not on. The launcher should handle that and should not
# silently drop me back to the console without anything to see."
#
# Two independent defects produced that single symptom, and both are pinned here
# (the second one structurally, since it lives outside the extractable region):
#
#   1. s03_run_launch_gate returned 'podman machine/socket unreachable' the
#      instant machine_ok was false. It never tried to START the machine -- even
#      though the machine_start seam already existed and was bound into the
#      interactive [l] recover flow. The remedy was reachable only AFTER the
#      failure, never on the path that hits it first.
#
#   2. The diagnosis was raised while the TUI had STDERR redirected into a temp
#      file. The clean teardown replayed that file; END and the INT/TERM handlers
#      only restored the filehandle and left it unread. So the message existed
#      and was never delivered.
#
# NEVER executes launcher.pl -- it builds container images and starts containers.
# The gate is extracted from its sentinel-delimited region and eval'd, exactly as
# plugins/sandbox/tests/t/container-health-detect.t already does.
