# The spinner shipped with ten frames and could only ever show TWO of them.
#
# THE DEFECT
#
#   $now      = sub { time };            # INTEGER seconds
#   $spin_div = $tick_int;               # 0.2 by default
#   spinner_idx = int($t / $spin_div);   # int(<integer> / 0.2)
#
# int(N / 0.2) for integer N is always a multiple of 5, so `% 10` over the ten
# braille frames could only ever produce index 0 or 5. The dashboard alternated
# between exactly two glyphs, once per second, for as long as it ran. Nine of
# the ten frames were unreachable by ARITHMETIC -- not by configuration, not by
# a missing glyph -- which is why it presented as a glyph-table problem and was
# not one.
#
# WHY NO EXISTING ORACLE CAUGHT IT
#
# t/100 AC-6b and t/25 block E both assert the spinner index AGREES WITH A
# FORMULA they compute themselves, and t/100 AC-1 asserts the ten frames are
# distinct when indices 0..9 are passed in BY HAND. Every one of those passes
# with a live loop that never generates more than two distinct indices. Agreement
# and reachability are different properties, and only the first was pinned.
#
# So this file asserts REACHABILITY over the real derivation, and it does so
# without hard-coding the period OR the frame count: it reads the production
# constants, so raising or lowering a cadence -- or re-styling the sequence, as
# 2026-08-25 did when the ten uneven-dot frames became eight uniform ones --
# stays legal, while making most of the frames unreachable does not.
#
# It also pins the two things that made the defect possible, so it cannot be
# reintroduced by the same route:
#   * animation is driven by a SUB-SECOND clock, not by $now's integer seconds
#   * animation cadence is NOT the render tick (the render tick is an
#     input-latency decision; coupling them is what set the period to 0.2 in
#     the first place)

# in-screen spinner, on the reasoning that a title is glanced at rather than
# watched and each change costs an OSC write. The operator watched it and asked
# for it faster, which settles the design question: the write is a dozen-odd
# bytes, emitted only when the title STRING changes, so it is not a cost worth
# a slower spinner.
#
# What still deserves pinning is that the title cadence is a real, bounded
# number rather than something that drifted to zero or to a value nobody would
# notice -- so it is bounded on both sides instead of ranked against the other.

    # were ever reachable -- for ten minutes, or forever. With eight frames
    # (2026-08-25) 5 and 8 are coprime, so 0.2 happens to reach all of them and
    # the fixture stopped demonstrating anything at all: still green, proving
    # nothing, which is the worst state a counter-fixture can be in.
    #
    # What is being reproduced is the COARSE LATTICE, not the number 0.2. A
    # period of 1/$N makes the index advance by exactly $N per second, so an
