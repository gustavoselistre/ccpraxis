# THE ORACLE for blueprint sandbox-launcher-lifecycle, package
# 01-launcher-and-its-terminal, written from
#   .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-launcher-lifecycle/specs/01-launcher-and-its-terminal-spec.md
# BEFORE the implementation exists.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. launcher.pl opens a Windows Terminal window via a
# fire-and-forget wt.exe spawn with no pid captured anywhere (launcher.pl:8791).
# A full, correct teardown chain already exists and runs on INT/TERM/HUP -- but
# HUP is not reliably delivered when the terminal window itself is destroyed on
# Windows. Report 20260917-032028-b91b measured two launchers surviving 37 hours
# after their terminals were gone, still rendering into consoles they no longer
# owned. This package makes the launcher notice its console host is gone and run
# the SAME teardown the TERM handler already runs.
#
# WHY A SENTINEL-DELIMITED EVAL REGION. launcher.pl is NEVER require'd/do'ne by
# this suite -- it is a top-level script with real side effects (raw-mode
# terminal, live subprocess launch, blocking keypress) and cannot be safely
# executed by a test. The house technique (precedent: wt-profile-spawn.t:18-26,
# itself precedented by container-health-detect.t) is to slurp launcher.pl as
# SOURCE TEXT, locate a sentinel-delimited region, and eval just that region
# into a fresh package. self_winpid / console_host_winpid / winpid_alive are
# pure, seam-driven functions precisely so this is possible: the production
# path and the tested path are the same subs, never a parallel reimplementation.
#
# WHAT IS EXPECTED TO FAIL TODAY. The 'console-liveness:BEGIN'/'console-liveness:END'
# sentinel comments do not exist in launcher.pl yet, _teardown_and_exit does not
# exist yet (INT/TERM are still inline one-liner subs), and
# $CONSOLE_LIVENESS_POLL_SECONDS / the gather-round wiring do not exist yet.
# Every assertion that depends on those is EXPECTED to report "not ok" until
# this package is implemented. Do not weaken any assertion below to make that
# future implementation's life easier.
#
# REAL-PROCESS SAFETY (AC-1 / AC-3). Two tests below spawn a real, native,
# console-owning cmd.exe child -- never wt.exe, never the full sandbox launch
# path (Decision 7 / this package's ledger explicitly forbids spawning
# launcher.pl's own image-build/container-start path unguarded). Every spawn is
# tracked in @SPAWNED_WINPIDS and force-killed in an END block, so a failed run
# (assertion death, BAIL_OUT, or an unexpected die) never leaves an orphaned
# console process behind. Poll loops are bounded by wall-clock elapsed time, not
# alarm(), so a hung backtick call cannot leave state half-updated.

# goes through this host's MSYS shell layer, which treats the bare `/PID`
# argument as a POSIX-style path and rewrites it (observed: `/PID` became
# `C:/Program Files/Git/PID`, so real taskkill.exe rejected it as an unknown
# option and never killed anything) -- the same MSYS argv-mangling landmine
# documented for `-v HOST:CONTAINER`, just triggered by a leading `/` instead
# of an embedded `:`. List-form system() alone does not avoid it (confirmed
# empirically: the same rewrite happens with `system('taskkill','/PID',...)`
# too), so both the shell-string route and plain list-form are unsafe here.
# Fix: scope $ENV{MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL}='*' to this one call (CLAUDE.md's
# documented safe pattern -- never set shell-wide) so the native taskkill.exe
# argv reaches it unmangled; verified against a real spawned+killed process.

# spawn_console_process() -> ($msys_pid, $winpid) | (undef, undef)
# Spawns a plain, distinct, native cmd.exe that owns its own console and stays
# alive for ~2 minutes (ping as a portable sleep with no extra tooling). NOT
# wt.exe, NOT conhost.exe directly, NOT the sandbox launch path.
#
# PORTABILITY NOTE (fixed 2026-09-18). The original implementation used
# Perl's Win32-only asynchronous-spawn calling convention, system(1, LIST)
# (perlport) to get the pid back immediately without waiting. That form is
# recognized ONLY on native MSWin32 Perl builds; this host runs Cygwin-
# flavored perl ($^O eq 'cygwin'), where system(1, LIST) is not special-cased
# at all -- it silently falls through and nothing is spawned, so both
# assertions that depend on this helper (AC-1, AC-3) failed with an
# empty/undef WINPID before ever reaching the winpid_alive/console_host_winpid
# code under test. Confirmed empirically (not by inspection alone) that
# system(1, @cmd) returns undef and spawns no process on this host.
#
# Fix: use `powershell.exe Start-Process -PassThru`, which does the real
# work here -- allocates cmd.exe its own native console window (same as a
# plain interactive launch; NOT started with any hidden/minimized window
# style), returns immediately without waiting for the child to exit, and
# hands back the child's real Win32 PID (== WINPID) directly via .Id, with
# no msys-pid-to-WINPID resolution step needed at all. This is portable
# across both native-Windows and Cygwin perl (it shells out to a real
# powershell.exe process either way) and was verified empirically: the
# spawned process shows Name=cmd.exe with a distinct ParentProcessId via
# Get-CimInstance, and a subsequent taskkill /PID <id> /F followed by the
# same CIM query returns no rows.
