#!/usr/bin/env perl
# 87 -- ORACLE for package t03 (blueprint
# butler-and-dashboard-overhaul), specs/t03-spec.md. Written
# BLIND to any dismiss-key implementation in Dashboard.pm / DashboardScreen.pm
# / launcher.pl -- straight from the spec's numbered observable behaviors
# (S3) and acceptance criteria (S4, AC1-AC6). Do NOT weaken an assertion here
# to make a future implementation's life easier.
#
# TODAY'S EXPECTED STATE (measured 2026-08-14, before this package's edit):
#   - launcher.pl still carries the trailing "- run /backpack:install in the
#     session to <verb>" instruction at both $INSTALL_WARNING sites.
#   - tui::DashboardScreen::_banner_lines appends no '[d] dismiss' hint.
#   - Dashboard::dispatch_key has no 'd' mapping at all -- ('d', $pending)
#     falls through to the same inert ('', $pending) as any other unknown key.
#   - Dashboard::run's main loop has no dismiss action branch and no
#     $install_warning_dismissed lexical -- a gathered install_warning is
#     never suppressed and reappears on every regather.
# So PART 1-5 below are expected RED; PART 6 (guard/regression assertions
# that already hold today, demanded by the spec so the ruling can't silently
# widen or narrow later) is expected GREEN both before and after -- flagged
# per-block, not hidden.
#
# NON-VACUITY: every "the banner is gone" claim is paired with a "the banner
# WAS there before" liveness assertion in the SAME block (never assumed), and
# every "no such control exists" claim is paired with a positive control
# proving the detection mechanism actually fires on a hand-built counter-
# fixture that SHOULD trip it.

# PART 7 -- fix-batch step 7, F1 (step-6 red-team MEDIUM-1): the dismiss
# mechanism is a blanket, content-blind, per-process mute (Dashboard.pm
# $install_warning_dismissed) -- once armed, EVERY future $state{install_warning}
# is suppressed, not just the one string that was on screen when 'd' was
# pressed. That is safe ONLY because of a cross-file invariant spec S2.4
# proves by hand: every $INSTALL_WARNING assignment in launcher.pl executes
# BEFORE Dashboard::run's loop is ever entered (_launch_stage_begin('dashboard')),
# so no "new, different" warning can ever arise while the loop -- and hence
# the mute -- is live. Before this block, that invariant was enforced by
# NOTHING: a future edit that added or moved an $INSTALL_WARNING assignment
# to after the dashboard stage would silently start swallowing a live,
# different warning, and every other assertion in this file would stay green
# (they all use fixed/static warning text, never a changing one across a
# single process's life).
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES: launcher.pl's $INSTALL_WARNING assignments are, TEXTUALLY,
# all positioned before the _launch_stage_begin('dashboard') call in the
# source file, which is the same evidence the reviewer/red-team verified by
# hand (redteam-step6.md MEDIUM-1) and the same evidence spec S2.4 itself
# relies on.
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE: that source-textual order equals RUNTIME
# execution order in every possible control-flow shape (e.g. it would not
# catch an assignment hoisted into a sub that is itself called after the
# dashboard stage begins, or reached via goto/eval). launcher.pl is a flat,
# top-to-bottom script with no such indirection around this code today
# (verified by reading the surrounding control flow at each site), so for
# THIS file, textual order is execution order -- but a reader relying on
# this test as a substitute for reading the code around a future assignment
# would be trusting a weaker guarantee than it looks like at first glance.
