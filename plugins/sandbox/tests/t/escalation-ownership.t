# 97 — "needs you" means the operator, not the queue.
#
# WHAT IS BEING PROTECTED
#
# The dashboard's `needs you` row counted every live record in runs/escalations/.
# Most of those are not the operator's: each carries a `category`, and only two
# of the seven (product, operator-action) are ones bp-resolve.pl may never
# decide. The rest go to the escalation resolver, which acts or re-tags them
# without waking anybody.
#
# So the row asserted ownership over a queue it had never looked inside. The
# operator saw "needs you: 1 decision waiting" with nothing whatsoever waiting on
# them -- reported verbatim as "the TUI for GSA says 'needs you: 1 decision
# waiting' despite the agent that was working on it doesn't really have anything
# that needs my attention?".
#
# t07 already fixed one half of this: a record whose package is done is settled
# and stops being counted. This is the other half — a record that is genuinely
# live, but is not YOURS.
#
# THE DEFAULT STAYS THE OPERATOR. RunState's own header states the asymmetry: a
# decision wrongly kept is a panel that nags, a decision wrongly dropped is a
# human who is never asked. So every unreadable, missing or unrecognised
# category counts as operator-owned — and that is not merely caution, it is
# correct: bp-orchestrator.pl's resolver dispatch filters on exactly the
# triageable set, so a record with an unrecognised category is one no agent will
# ever look at again.
