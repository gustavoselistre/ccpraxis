# Oracle test for s18-terminal-minimize-spike, derived from
#   .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-butler-overhaul/specs/s18-terminal-minimize-spike-spec.md
#
# IMMUTABLE ORACLE: written from the spec alone. The implementer writes
# plugins/sandbox/docs/terminal-minimize-investigation.md from the scout
# report (never sees this file); this file is written from the spec (never
# sees the scout report or the implementer's doc). This file is expected to
# FAIL until that document lands, conforming to spec section 2.1-2.8. That is
# the correct, intended state.
#
# HARD BOUNDARY (spec section 3.12, AC-12, section 6): this test reads ONE
# text file and pattern-matches it. It never shells out to launcher.pl,
# podman, powershell.exe, taskkill, or any live-terminal probe, and it never
# claims to verify that a real Windows window actually minimizes -- that
# behavior is structurally unreproducible in this container.
#
# Two coordinator rulings applied here (override spec text where they conflict):
#   1. Section 2.1's "no other H1/H2 may appear between them" is VOID. Per
#      section 5, required headings are matched by presence-in-order, not
#      adjacency; extra H2/H3 sections are permitted and must not fail the
#      test.
#   2. Section 2.3's "exactly these four H3 headings" means these four are
#      REQUIRED, verbatim, in order -- NOT that the total H3 count is 4. No
#      assertion below counts total headings of any level.
#
# Criterion mapping (AC-1 .. AC-12, spec section 4):
#   AC-1  : doc exists on disk
#   AC-2  : H1 + six required H2 headings present, verbatim, in order
#   AC-3  : four required H3 candidate headings present, verbatim, in order
#   AC-4  : each candidate H3 section has >=1 Verdict line, token in the
#           closed vocabulary
#   AC-5  : Candidate 3 body contains "Finding A"; Candidate 4 body contains
#           "Finding E"
#   AC-6  : Reproduction status has a valid Status: token and non-empty Reason:
#   AC-7  : Conclusion has Cause identified: YES|NO; if NO, also Narrowed to:
#           and Evidence needed:
#   AC-8  : Recommended fix has a valid Recommendation: token and the fields
#           required for that branch
#   AC-9  : Follow-on packages has >=2 entries, one mentioning A2, one B2
#   AC-10 : Operator requests has exactly four numbered items, one containing
#           "decisive"
#   AC-11 : this file runs standalone, ends with done_testing(), no fixed plan
#   AC-12 : this file contains no invocation of launcher.pl/podman/
#           powershell.exe/taskkill or any live-terminal probe
