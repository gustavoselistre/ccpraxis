# 108 — the orphan reaper selects exactly what it should, and nothing else.
#
# Bug report 20260828-095201-7c1e: a perl.exe running a throwaway probe out of a
# session scratchpad was found alive NINE DAYS AND NINETEEN HOURS after its
# session had exited, parent gone, 0.016s of CPU burnt in total. Nothing
# recorded it, killed it, or swept for it. It was found by accident.

# THIS TEST NEVER SPAWNS OR KILLS A PROCESS. scripts/reap-orphans.pl is split
# into a pure selection library and a `unless (caller)` CLI precisely so the
# oracle can feed it synthetic process lists. A test for a process reaper that
# actually reaps is a test that can take out something it did not mean to --
# and this suite runs unattended, in parallel, on the operator's own machine.
#
# The assertions that matter are the NEGATIVE ones. Failing to reap a leak costs
# 11 MB; reaping something live costs the operator their work. So every reason a
# process must be spared gets its own case, and each is written so it fails if
# that single guard is removed.
