#
# Bug report 20260828-095201-7c1e: a perl.exe running a throwaway probe out of a
# session scratchpad was found alive NINE DAYS AND NINETEEN HOURS after its
# session had exited, parent gone, 0.016s of CPU burnt in total. Nothing
# recorded it, killed it, or swept for it. It was found by accident.

# THIS TEST NEVER SPAWNS OR KILLS A PROCESS. scripts/reap-orphans.pl is split
# into a pure selection library and a `unless (caller)` CLI precisely so the
# oracle can feed it synthetic process lists. A test for a process reaper that
# actually reaps is a test that can take out something it did not mean to --
# and this suite runs unattended, in parallel, on the operator's own machine.
#
# The assertions that matter are the NEGATIVE ones. Failing to reap a leak costs
# 11 MB; reaping something live costs the operator their work. So every reason a
# process must be spared gets its own case, and each is written so it fails if
# that single guard is removed.

# THE PID NAMESPACE. Bug 20260917-033101-c455.
#
# enumerate_windows collects pids from `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process`, which are
# WINDOWS pids. perl's kill(), getppid() and $$ under Git-for-Windows are MSYS
# pids -- different numbers for the same process (`ps -W` prints both columns).
# Crossing them does not error; it answers "no such process", which reads as a
# real answer.
#
# The old kill block used perl `kill(0, $winpid)` to VERIFY a taskkill. That is
# false for every live Windows process, so $ok became 1 unconditionally: EVERY
# KILL REPORTED SUCCESS and @failed could not be populated. It was found after
# two launchers survived 37 hours on this host and the reaping story could not
# be trusted either way.
#
# These are SOURCE assertions, not behavioural ones, for the reason this file
# states at the top: a test for a reaper that actually reaps is a test that can
# take out the operator's own work.
