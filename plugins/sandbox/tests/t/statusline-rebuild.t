# 69 -- the ORACLE for blueprint unified-tui-design-system,
# package 10
# (specs/10-spec.md).
#
# Written BLIND to scripts/statusline.pl and plugins/butler/scripts/
# bp-statusline.pl -- neither file was read while this oracle was written.
# Every expectation comes from the spec, so this file is an oracle rather than
# an echo of whatever the implementer eventually writes. Do NOT weaken an
# assertion to make a future implementation's life easier.
#
# Coverage: AC-S, AC-E, AC-O, AC-M, AC-P, AC-D, AC-B, AC-G (spec S4).
#
# HARD CONSTRAINTS honoured here (spec S4.0):
#   * NEVER spawns launcher.pl, never builds an image, never starts a
#     container. Only the two plain filter scripts are spawned, each bounded
#     by `timeout`, exactly as t/tui-output-hygiene.t and t/spend-panel.t
#     already spawn them.
#   * Fixtures live only under File::Temp tempdir()/tempfile().
#   * Never redirects to NUL; /dev/null only.
#   * No whole-shape pins (Decision 15): no rendered-row count, no field
#     inventory, no key-set comparison, no assertion of MIN_CWD_COLS /
#     MIN_PROJECT_COLS / the marker slot width. "Same slot, same width" is
#     asserted as a RELATIONSHIP between the two rendered variants.
#   * Whole-line `#` comments are blanked before every source scan, because
#     this oracle's own subject matter is the constructs being scanned for.
#   * Call forms are targeted, never bare words: \bwarn\s*\( , not \bwarn\b
#     (which would match the mandated role name state.warn).
#   * \Q...\E does not interpolate escapes, so escape-byte searches use
#     index($s, "\e[...") instead.
#   * This file deliberately does NOT carry the generated-block begin marker
#     at column 0 -- t/64's repo-wide walk fails if that line appears in any
#     .pl/.pm/.t outside the listed surface. Where the literal is needed it is
#     built by concatenation.
#
# ENCODING DISCIPLINE (spec S4.0, C-9): both scripts' stdout is read as RAW
# BYTES. Every expectation compared against it is bytes.

# AC-N -- the project name inside a sandbox.
#
# The project is bind-mounted at /project, so in-container `git rev-parse
# --show-toplevel` returns `/project` and basename() yields the literal word
# "project" -- for EVERY project on the machine. The field whose whole job is to
# say which project you are in was the one field that could never say it.
#
# The launcher writes the real name to claude-home/project-name, which is a live
# bind mount and therefore lands at $HOME/.claude/project-name immediately, in
# containers created before the fix as well. An env var would have been the
# obvious choice and the wrong one -- `podman create` bakes env at creation, so
# it would have fixed only containers made afterwards.
