# 63 — ORACLE for package 04-run-panel-ledger-truth
# (blueprint unified-tui-design-system), specs/04-run-panel-ledger-truth-spec.md.
# Written BLIND to any RunState.pm/launcher.pl implementation of THIS package
# -- directly from the spec's numbered observable behaviours (S3, B1-B34) and
# acceptance criteria (S4, AC-1..AC-27) -- so this file is an oracle, not an
# echo of whatever the implementer eventually writes.
#
# TODAY'S EXPECTED STATE, recorded so a future reader is not surprised:
#   - RunState.pm exists (it is the s10 module from a prior blueprint) but has
#     NOT been extended with this package's ledger-truth / liveness logic yet:
#     summarize_dir is still registry-gated, $RunState::PID_ALIVE does not
#     exist, and `state` only ever produces the 4 legacy values.
#   - launcher.pl has neither a `_pid_alive` sub nor an assignment to
#     `$RunState::PID_ALIVE` yet.
#   Both are read from disk (RunState.pm required as a module; launcher.pl
#   read as source TEXT ONLY) so every section below reports HONESTLY on
#   today's tree rather than aborting compilation.
#
# HARD CONSTRAINTS:
#   * launcher.pl is NEVER require'd/do'ne/executed here -- source-text slurp
#     + regex/brace-balance extraction only, exactly as t/44/t/45/t/62 do.
#   * This file must NOT `use utf8`; the Andre fixture path segment (S5.4) is
#     written as an explicit UTF-8 byte escape ("Andr\xC3\xA9"), never a
#     \x{...} char, exactly like t/45's Andre fixture.
#   * Every fixture lives only under File::Temp::tempdir(CLEANUP => 1).
#     Nothing here reads .ccpraxis-local-data/ (gitignored, does not travel):
#     the 37-vs-79 fixture (AC-13/AC-14) is SYNTHETIC, modelled on the shape
#     of the real sandbox-butler-overhaul registry/ledger mismatch, not read
#     from it.
#   * No whole-shape pins (Decision 15): no is_deeply over the summary
#     struct's key set, no pin on any OPEN-ENDED discovered collection. Every
#     count asserted below is over a fixture this file built and fully
#     controls (the same sense in which t/45's AC-6/AC-24 assert
#     scalar(@$list) == <a fixture-controlled N> without that being a
#     "whole-shape pin" -- the forbidden class is pinning a CLOSED, unrelated
#     set like t/45:293's exact-11-keys assertion, which this file does not
#     repeat).
#   * This file spawns no process, forks nothing, opens no network
#     connection, touches no container.

# ===========================================================================

# Shared fixture for AC-4..AC-7. LEDGER-BACKED, and it has to be.
#
# This used to have no packages/ dir at all, relying on the registry key-set
# fallback to supply the package list. The fallback still works -- it is what
# gives packages_total below -- but s02's Decision 13 removed the registry's
# authority over STATUS: _effective_status returns '' for a package with no
# ledger, because butler no longer writes registry.status. So every package's
# effective status was '', running_coordinators was 0 no matter what the injected
# prober said, and AC-5/AC-6 failed while AC-4 ("dead -> 0") passed VACUOUSLY --
# 0 was the answer for every liveness verdict, so the block tested nothing about
# liveness at all.
#
# That is the real defect here, and it is the same shape as t/126's BQ2, fixed
# earlier today: an assertion describing behaviour a design decision removed,
# carried as a red (and a false green beside it) rather than corrected.
#
# Giving the fixture real ledgers restores what AC-4..AC-7 are FOR -- that a
# per-package coordinator PID is liveness-checked, and that an UNKNOWN probe
# never demotes a package -- instead of re-pinning the expectations to 0, which
# would have made the whole block permanently vacuous.
#
# The registry-fallback path itself keeps its own dedicated coverage elsewhere in
# this file (S3 behaviour #6); nothing is lost by this fixture using ledgers.
