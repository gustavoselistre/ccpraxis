# This file is the IMMUTABLE ORACLE for blueprint sandbox-butler-overhaul,
# package s09 (specs/s09-spec.md). It is
# written BLIND to any Resources.pm / Dashboard.pm / launcher.pl
# implementation -- directly from the spec -- so it can serve as an oracle
# rather than an echo of whatever the implementer eventually writes.
#
# Coverage: AC-1..AC-32 (spec S4). AC-33 (whole-suite-green gate) is
# deliberately NOT encoded here -- it is a coordinator-side check, exactly as
# t/43 treats its AC-22.
#
# Resources.pm DOES NOT EXIST YET, and neither Dashboard::_resources_lines /
# pressure_role / gauge / fmt_bytes nor the launcher wiring have landed. Every
# call below goes through a helper that wraps the call in `eval`, so a missing
# module/sub degrades to a clean per-assertion FAIL rather than aborting the
# file. That is EXPECTED and correct until the implementer lands s09.
#
# Hard constraints honoured here (spec S7):
#   * self-contained -- every fixture is INLINED as a Perl string literal;
#     this file never reads .ccpraxis-local-data/ (gitignored, does not travel).
#   * launcher.pl is NEVER require'd/do'ne -- source-text slurp + regex only,
#     plus `perl -c` in a subprocess (t/36:3's stated convention).
#   * this file MUST NOT `use utf8`; glyphs are "\x{...}" escapes encoded to
#     UTF-8 bytes via Encode::encode.
#   * no real clock, no sleep -- the slow-probe assertion (AC-21) drives
#     Resources::gather with an injected fake clock.
#
# SPEC CONFLICT recorded in-place (see the AC-23 block): spec S3 B12 pins
# should_sample(0, 0, 23) => 1, but the binding algorithm in S2.3 yields 0
# (0 and 0 are both numeric, 0 is not < 0, and 0 - 0 >= 23 is false). This
# file asserts the S2.3 algorithm -- the normative interface contract -- and
# additionally asserts the startup behaviour B12's vector was reaching for.

#
# The cross-boundary no-spawn proof (AC-1..AC-6), the sampler (AC-7..AC-11),
# snapshot & atomicity (AC-12..AC-17), four-state distinguishability
# (AC-18..AC-20), probe starvation (AC-21..AC-22), and purity (AC-23..AC-24).
# All against specs/03-resources-reader-model-spec.md.
#
# THE ONE STRUCTURAL FACT THIS SECTION EXISTS TO NAIL DOWN (spec S1.3):
# t/tui-adapter-contract.t's call-closure walker is SAME-FILE ONLY, by
# documented design. Deleting its %WAIVED entry for _gather_resources
# therefore proves *necessary but not sufficient* -- moving the podman/
# PowerShell probes behind Resources:: would silence t/62 while the fork
# stayed on the render tick. The walker below is that SAME detector's shape
# (_cw_blank/_cw_subs/_cw_get_body/_cw_edges/_cw_spawns mirror t/62's
# _blank_noncode/_subs/_get_body/_edges_from/_spawns construct-for-construct
# -- spec AC-3's own instruction to reuse the proven shape), EXTENDED with
# one new edge kind: a qualified "$qualifier::<name>(" call resolves into a
# SECOND file's own sub table and recurses through THAT file's same-file
# calls. AC-5 is the mandatory negative control proving this extension can
# actually detect a violation -- without it an empty cross-file closure
# would pass AC-3 silently, exactly the failure mode package 02 shipped
# three times over (spec AC-5's own text).
#
# AC-11 (DC-6, "launcher.pl still compiles / Resources.pm compiles and loads
# cleanly") is judged already covered, verbatim, by the pre-existing AC-32
# block just above -- same two files, same `perl -c` subprocess convention.
# Not duplicated here.
#
# AC-25 (t/62 passes with %WAIVED empty) and AC-26 (whole-suite-green judged
# against the pre-change baseline) are coordinator-level checks, exactly as
# this file's own header treats its AC-33 -- verified by running t/62 and
# the sandbox suite directly, not encoded as an assertion in this file.

#     SOURCE by the driver (reports/03-resources-reader-model/{reviewer,

#     require'd/do'ne and podman/launcher.pl are NEVER invoked from this file.
#
#     MINOR-1 checked, no test change needed: neither this file nor t/53
#     contains "SandboxLock"/"concurrent"/"prevented upstream" prose
#     repeating the spec's false claim that SandboxLock prevents two
#     concurrent dashboards/samplers -- the actual (safe) mechanism is
#     owner-liveness (H1's fix below), not lock scope. Recorded here so a
#     future editor does not reintroduce the false reason in a comment.

#     bp-baseline.pl:266 -- /usr/bin/timeout is available on this host and
#     exits 124 on expiry), so a hung podman/WSL backend can no longer block
#     the sampler's round forever and starve the once-per-round
#     kill(0,$owner_pid) liveness gate at the top of _resources_sampler_main's
#     loop. Source-level only -- never spawns podman or timeout(1). ---
