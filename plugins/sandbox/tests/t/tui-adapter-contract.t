# 62 — the TUI panel-adapter contract's ENFORCEMENT,
# for blueprint unified-tui-design-system, package 01-adapter-contract
# (specs/01-adapter-contract-spec.md). Written BLIND to any doc /
# launcher.pl implementation beyond what launcher.pl already looks like
# today — directly from the spec — so this serves as an ORACLE rather than
# an echo of whatever the doc-writer/implementer eventually write. Do NOT
# weaken an assertion here to make a future implementation's life easier.
#
# WHAT THIS GUARDS (spec S1). launcher.pl carries seven `_gather_*` panel
# adapters, all called from the dashboard's render/state tick. Rule 1 of the
# doctrine this test enforces is "never fork, spawn or block on the render
# tick". A purely TEXTUAL scan of a `sub _gather_*` BODY cannot prove that:
# `_gather_resources`'s own body contains no spawn construct at all — the
# backticks live in same-file helpers it calls (`_resources_probes`,
# `_powershell_json`). So this guard FOLLOWS CALLS: for every discovered
# adapter it computes the transitive same-file call closure and flags a
# spawn construct found anywhere in that closure (spec S2.2.4). A body-local
# scan would find zero violations and make the whole package vacuous — see
# spec S1's "critical structural fact" and S7-E1.
#
# HARD CONSTRAINTS honoured here (spec S2.2, AC-10):
#   * launcher.pl is SLURPED as source text only — never require'd, do'ne,
#     or executed (t/tui-output-hygiene.t's established convention).
#   * No network, no container I/O, no podman, no launcher.pl spawn.
#   * Fixtures live only under File::Temp::tempdir(CLEANUP => 1).
#   * No `prove` on this host — runs standalone via `perl <file>`.
#
# NO SHAPE PINS (AC-6, Decision 15): no count over the discovered adapter
# set anywhere, no is_deeply over it. Non-vacuity is carried by (a) a >=1
# discovery floor, (b) a named-membership floor (_gather_spend and
# _gather_resources are among the discovered — not a shape pin: it forbids
# nothing from being ADDED, only deleting one of those two names can turn it
# red, and that IS a signal worth having; spec S4 AC-6's own note), and (c)
# the synthetic-fixture self-test below (spec S3-C), which proves the
# analyser catches direct / two-hop / cyclic / piped-open spawns and ignores
# comments / qualified calls / unreached code — independent of launcher.pl's
# current content, so it is stale-proof.
#
# THE WAIVER LIST (spec S2.2.5) lives in this file, not a separate data
# file, because package 03's write set includes this test but no data file.
# It is not a pardon: emptying it is package 03's on-disk proof of landing.

# _blank_noncode($src) -> $src2, SAME NUMBER OF LINES as the input (so line
# numbers computed against the blanked text stay usable in failure
# messages). Two passes (spec S2.2.1):
#
#   A. POD — blank (replace with '', keep the newline) every line from a
#      line matching /^=[a-zA-Z]/ through the following /^=cut\b/ inclusive.
#      (launcher.pl carries no POD today; cheap insurance regardless.)
#
#   B. comments, per line:
#      1. a whole-line `#...` comment (/^(\s*)#/) is blanked outright to its
#         leading whitespace. This alone handles launcher.pl's dense
#         full-line prose commentary that DISCUSSES backticks/forking/
#         spawning — launcher.pl:4509-4520, 4540-4549, 4690-4700 are the
#         live cases this must survive (see the "prose" fixture row below).
#      2. otherwise the line is scanned left to right tracking three
#         toggles (single-quote / double-quote / backtick), where a
#         character preceded by a backslash never toggles anything, and is
#         truncated at the first '#' that is outside all three, not
#         preceded by '$' (so $#array survives), and is at column 0 or
#         preceded by whitespace.
#
# STATED LIMITS (spec S2.2.1, recorded here per the spec's instruction): a
# '#' inside q{}/qq{}/m{}/qw() delimiters is not modelled, and a quote
# character inside a regex character class can desynchronise the toggles
# for the rest of that one line. Both fail SAFE for this guard — the worst
# case is a comment survives, which can only produce a false POSITIVE (a
# named, line-numbered failure a human sees), never a silent pass.
#
# CORRECTED (test-writer fix-batch, redteam H-10 / reviewer MINOR-2): an
# earlier draft of this comment claimed "neither pattern occurs in
# launcher.pl today". That is FALSE, in two places, though harmlessly so:
#   * A close relative of the char-class pattern — an ESCAPED quote
#     immediately before a line's end — occurs at launcher.pl:1439
#     (`$s =~ s/"/\\"/g;`) and :1442 (`$s =~ s/'/'\\''/g;`). Each leaves
#     this pass's in_dq/in_sq toggle stuck ON for the rest of THAT physical
#     line (the per-line reset below means it never bleeds into the next
#     line). It is harmless TODAY only because neither line carries a
#     trailing '#' for the stuck toggle to hide — not because the desync
#     doesn't happen.
#   * A close relative of the q{}-delimiter pattern — a bare apostrophe in
#     prose INSIDE a multi-line q{} literal — occurs at launcher.pl:352
#     ("Claude Code's own configuration home") and :369 ("Claude Code's
#     configuration, and every other project on the machine"). Same
#     per-line-reset mechanism, and additionally neither of those subs
#     (`_pp_explanation`/`_pp_advice`) is reachable from any `_gather_*`
#     adapter's closure, so it cannot affect this guard's real findings
#     even if it did desync.
# Net: the SAFE-FAILURE property (a comment survives, never a silent pass)
# holds either way; only the "doesn't occur" claim was wrong, and it is
# corrected here rather than softened.

# _subs($blanked) -> \%subs { name => { start_line, start_pos } }.

# 0 — find every /^sub\s+([A-Za-z_]\w*)\s*\{/m match (spec S2.2.2).
#
# STATED LIMITS (spec S2.2.2, UPDATED by the test-writer fix-batch): a sub
# defined at an indent, or a `sub` keyword at column 0 inside a (non-heredoc)
# string, would still defeat this. Two things that USED to be limits no
# longer are:
#   * A heredoc body whose line begins with `}` no longer desyncs
#     brace-counting — Pass H in `_blank_noncode` (H-2) blanks heredoc
#     bodies before this function ever sees them, so their braces never
#     enter the count.
#   * A genuine one-line sub (`sub log_ev { LaunchLog::event($LAUNCH_LOG,
#     @_) }`, launcher.pl:773, one of 11 such subs in launcher.pl today) no
#     longer fails extraction — `_get_body` below accepts a single-line
#     body as well as a multi-line one ending `}` at column 0 (H-4).
#
# launcher.pl has exactly one heredoc (launcher.pl:3493-3503, an inline bash
# install script) and it IS inside a sub — `s03_run_launch_gate`, which opens
# at launcher.pl:3260. (An earlier draft of this comment, and spec S2.2.2,
# both claimed it sat at top-level flow before any sub. That is wrong; the
# driver checked. Corrected here so nobody inherits the wrong reason to feel
# safe.) Its braces balance on a single line (`cleanup() { ...; }`) and it
# contains no `#`, so even without Pass H it would not have desynced
# anything today — but Pass H now makes that true STRUCTURALLY rather than
# by the heredoc's current, coincidental content.
#
# What makes an actual desync acceptable rather than a latent trap: the
# failure is loud, not silent. The two structural validations below
# hard-FAIL naming the sub if an extraction desyncs, and the B-B10
# cross-check fails if a `_gather_*` sub goes missing from the parsed node
# set. Nothing here degrades to a quiet skip — which is the one way a
# violator could hide (see also H-4(b) below, which closes the one place
# that WAS a quiet skip: an extraction failure inside an adapter's closure,
# not at the top level, used to silently drop that member's findings from
# the per-adapter tally even though the standalone failure above still
# fired).

# from inside that deliberately-broken fixture turning THIS suite's own

# threaded straight through to _get_body/_closure (see their doc comments);
# only the H-4(b) self-test substitutes a non-failing recorder.
#
# 'extraction_unknown' is itself H-4(b)'s fix: previously, a body-extraction
# failure anywhere in an adapter's closure fired ONE standalone, named
# fail() inside _get_body (B-B9) -- loud -- but the per-adapter tally below
# would then silently go on to report "zero forbidden-spawn findings" (or a
# "known non-conforming, here is the ONE finding we did see") for that same
# adapter, because _closure()/_get_body()'s "next unless defined $body"
# means the failed member's own findings AND its entire further subtree are
# simply missing from @findings. That reads as a clean bill of health for a
# subtree the guard admits it could not see -- a silent downgrade at the
# adapter-verdict level even though the sub-level failure was loud. Any
