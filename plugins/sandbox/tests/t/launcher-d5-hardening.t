#
# IMMUTABLE ORACLE: written from the spec BEFORE the implementation exists.
# launcher.pl does not yet carry the fixes for the five D5 findings at
# authoring time -- most of the assertions below are EXPECTED to read "not
# ok" until q05 lands. Do not weaken these assertions to make a future
# implementation's life easier.
#
# ZERO-REAL-I/O + NO-LAUNCH RULE: this file never spawns launcher.pl, never
# builds an image, never starts a container. It exercises launcher.pl's own
# logic in two ways only:
#   (a) source-structural assertions on launcher.pl's text (like t/53's
#       Group A/H), and
#   (b) EXTRACTING real fragments of launcher.pl's own source text (the
#       q03:protected-path-decision sentinel region, and the span from the
#       CCPRAXIS_AUTH_HOME computation through the protected_path_outcome
#       call-site block) and eval-ing them into an isolated package, with
#       %ENV faked via `local %ENV` (restored after every call) and any
#       `exit()` inside the extracted call-site block trapped via a
#       compile-time-scoped `local *CORE::GLOBAL::exit` override so it can
#       never terminate this test process. No filesystem is touched outside
#       a File::Temp tempdir (auto-CLEANUP), and never the real HOME,
#       USERPROFILE, CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, or ~/.claude.
#
# This is the same "eval the real extracted source" idiom t/53 already uses
# for the sentinel region (its AC-10 harness) -- extended here to also cover
# the launcher's OWN wiring immediately around the call site, because C1/C2/
# C5/C6/C7/C9 are specifically about whether registry_path/extra_list_path
# are derived THROUGH the authoritative-home seam at that exact call site,
# which the pure ProtectedPaths.pm module alone cannot prove.
#
# Criterion mapping (see the full table in this header and inline comments):
#   C1        : HOME redirected to a decoy -- marketplace roots still derived,
#               refused target still refused (D5's reproduction case)
#   C2        : same for USERPROFILE alone, and both together
#   C3        : _pp_env_seam hardens both HOME and USERPROFILE; unrelated key
#               and undef authoritative_home still fall through
#   C4        : the authoritative-home gate is keyed on $^O ne 'MSWin32' alone
#               (driven via injected $^O), not $WINDOWS_FAMILY; $WINDOWS_FAMILY
#               itself is unnarrowed
#   C5        : registry_path AND extra_list_path both derived through the seam
#   C6        : extra list unions CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR with the home candidates
#               and falls back correctly when unset
#   C7        : CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR does NOT redirect the registry (paired with
#               a vacuity gate that it DOES redirect the extra list)
#   C8        : live_install_hint passes the bare-root/home rejection guards;
#               a legitimate hint is still admitted and reason-ranked
#   C9        : no regression -- a ccpraxis clone outside the install and an
#               ordinary project still route passthrough (refuse == 0)
#   C10       : validation commands only, recorded not re-implemented (see

# registry/extra-list roots from the authoritative home in the plain
# HOME-redirected case, *given that $CCPRAXIS_AUTH_HOME is available* --
# because _pp_env_seam already hardens the 'HOME' key today (only
# USERPROFILE is unhardened, item 1). Measured directly: calling
# protected_roots() with an explicit, DECOY-rooted registry_path/
# extra_list_path but a seam-hardened env_fn('HOME') still resolves the
# marketplace/extra-list roots via that fan-out. So refuse/reason/root
# alone, below, are real correctness checks but are NOT independently
# red-before-green for the registry_path/extra_list_path literal bypass
# itself (item 3) -- they would already pass unfixed, given a defined
# authoritative home. The genuinely discriminating signal is structural:
# item 3 requires registry_path/extra_list_path to be derived THROUGH the

# net that item 3's fix must not be read as license to omit (spec S3: "Both

# cannot move them" -- a requirement on the call site, not on whether some
# other path happens to still work). So: assert the extracted span (from
# immediately after $CCPRAXIS_AUTH_HOME's computation through the call)
# itself derives the value it interpolates as $CLAUDE_HOST_CONFIG from
