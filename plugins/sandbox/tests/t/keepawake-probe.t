# s21-keep-awake-probe-failure-handling: a transient podman-exec failure must
# not SIGKILL the wake-lock and re-spawn it.
#
# This file is the IMMUTABLE ORACLE for blueprint sandbox-butler-overhaul,
# package s21-keep-awake-probe-failure-handling
# (specs/s21-keep-awake-probe-failure-handling-spec.md). Written BLIND to any
# launcher.pl / KeepAwake.pm change the implementer makes -- directly from the
# spec -- so it serves as an oracle rather than an echo. Do NOT weaken an
# assertion to make a future implementation's life easier.
#
# Coverage: C1..C8 (spec S3).
#
# HARD CONSTRAINTS honoured here:
#   * PURE/structural: never spawns launcher.pl, never builds an image, never
#     starts a container. launcher.pl is SLURPED for source-text assertions
#     only (t/48/t/59's established convention) -- never require'd/do'ne.
#   * Fixtures are in-memory / File::Temp only.
#
# ===========================================================================
# INTERFACE THIS ORACLE PINS -- spec S2.1 explicitly delegates the struct's
# field names to this file ("Suggested shape ... the oracle pins the names"),
# but does NOT name the decision-layer entry point itself. Rather than test
# nothing executable for the headline criterion (C4 -- the assertion that
# would have caught the original defect), this file pins ONE minimal,
# backward-compatible extension of KeepAwake.pm's existing object model:
#
#   The probe result struct (spec S2.1, verbatim):
#     { state => 'ok',            age => $seconds }
#     { state => 'lease-absent'                  }
#     { state => 'probe-failed',  detail => $str }
#     { state => 'container-gone', detail => $str }
#
#   KeepAwake->new(...)->on_probe(\%result, $stale, $tolerance) -> $action
#     $action is sync()'s existing vocabulary: 'start' | 'stop' | 'noop'.
#     'ok'            -> sync(should_stay_awake(age, stale)) -- age-based,
#                        reusing the UNCHANGED pure decision (C6).
#     'lease-absent'  -> sync(0, reason => 'lease-absent')
#     'container-gone'-> sync(0, reason => 'container-gone')
#     'probe-failed'  -> HOLDS (no sync call at all -- not even a 'noop'
#                        transition attempt) while the consecutive
#                        probe-failed streak is <= $tolerance; once the
#                        streak exceeds $tolerance, releases via
#                        sync(0, reason => 'probe-failed'). Any non
#                        probe-failed state resets the streak.
#     $tolerance is an explicit CALLER-SUPPLIED argument (mirroring
#     should_stay_awake's existing $stale parameter) -- never a value this
#     oracle hardcodes or reads off a launcher.pl constant. That is what lets
#     C5 "drive the count, not pin the value": the test picks its own small
#     tolerance and proves the behaviour at and past that boundary, without
#     ever asserting what launcher.pl's real default is.
#
#   KeepAwake::sync($want, %extra) -- backward-compatible: existing one-arg
#     callers (t/59's C2, and every current launcher.pl call site) are
#     unaffected; %extra, if given, is merged into the on_event payload on a
#     TRANSITION ONLY (never on a 'noop'), which is how C3's log
#     distinguishability is carried without adding a second emit path.
#
# An implementation that reuses these two names satisfies the executable
# criteria below directly. An implementation that solves the SAME problem
# under different names is not automatically "wrong" -- but this oracle has
# no way to discover an unpinned name without guessing (the exact trap s16's
# header warns about), so pinning a reasoned, minimal, backward-compatible
# interface is the least-bad option available while spec S2.1 leaves it open.
