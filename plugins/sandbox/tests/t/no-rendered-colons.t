# t05-no-colons -- the oracle for blueprint tui-operator-feedback.
#
# Operator, verbatim: "we use way too many instances of the character `:`. Its
# distracting. We need none of them." -- and, asked about the one conflict,
# they confirmed blueprint Decision 2: clock times keep theirs.
#
# THE ASSERTION THAT MATTERS IS THE SWEEP, not the six call sites. Criterion 5
# asks that a future label cannot quietly reintroduce a colon, and a test that
# names the six places we fixed would not notice a seventh. So this composes
# real frames across a matrix of states and widths and asserts that NO rendered
# row carries a colon outside a clock time -- which is a property of the screen
# rather than a list of the edits.
#
# WHAT THE RULE DOES NOT TOUCH (blueprint Decision 20): values. A label gutter,
# a provider prefix and a warning sentence are text this repo AUTHORS and lose
# their colons. An event body, a blueprint name, a container name, a path, an
# error string from a subprocess are DATA passing through the renderer --
# rewriting those would make the screen disagree with the thing it reports on.
# PART 3 asserts that directly, because a rule enforced too widely is its own
# defect.
