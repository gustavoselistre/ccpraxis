# AN UNREADABLE PROBE IS NOT A DEFINITE NEGATIVE.
#
# The rule 20260915-230820-d33e states, and the two places that broke it.
#
# The operator watched a live blueprint fleet with the dashboard open and read:
#
#     busy-lease    none (no active run)
#     keep-awake    released (PC may sleep)
#
# while inside the container the lease was being refreshed every two to ten
# seconds. "I could not read the lease" and "there is no lease" are different
# facts, and only one of them justifies letting the machine sleep. The panel
# collapsed the first into the second, so the most alarming thing on the screen
# was also the least trustworthy.
#
# Two mechanisms had to be fixed for the rule to hold end to end:
#
#   RENDER  -- tui::DashboardScreen had no vocabulary for "unreadable". Its
#              busy-lease row keyed off `defined $state->{busy_age}` alone, and
#              a failed probe leaves that undef exactly as an idle container
#              does. Now the probe reading travels with the state.
#
#   DECIDE  -- launcher.pl had TWO keep-awake decision sites. The throttled one
#              (KeepAwake::on_probe) holds the lock through a probe failure on
#              purpose. The per-refresh `keepawake` seam then re-derived
#              staleness from a cached age that is deliberately FROZEN during a
#              failure -- so the extrapolated age grew without bound, crossed
#              the stale threshold, and released the very lock the first site
#              was holding. A tolerance that a second, probe-blind decision can
#              overrule is not a tolerance.
#
# The render half is behavioural against the real module. The decision half is
# structural: the seam lives inside enter_dashboard's closure and cannot be
# called in isolation, so this file pins the properties that make it correct
# and the companion assertions in busy-lease-path-conversion.t pin the shape.
