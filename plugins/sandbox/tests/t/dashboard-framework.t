# count_banner_starts(\@alert_rows) -- fix-batch step 7 (d02-wrap-every-
# surface, reviewer MUST-FIX #1, red-team follow-up).
#
# The step-6 amended assertions counted "banner-start rows" (a width-
# invariant proxy for "how many banners are present", since a wrapped
# banner now spans more than one row -- Decision D1) with an UNANCHORED
# `grep { $_->{text} =~ /!! / }`. That matches the literal substring "!! "
# anywhere in a row's text, including a CONTINUATION row whose wrapped
# content happens to contain "!! " (e.g. install_warning text containing
# "urgent!!"), silently inflating the count. The reviewer reproduced a
# 2-banner fixture miscounted as 3; the red-team follow-up went further and
# reproduced a 1-REAL-banner fixture miscounted as 2 -- the sharper failure,
# because it is "a banner is genuinely missing but the assertion still
# passes" territory (driver-verified against Dashboard::compose_frame
# directly, see the two pinned assertions below this helper's call sites).
#
# DO NOT "fix" this by anchoring the regex to `^!! ` instead (`/^!! /`).
# That was the reviewer's own suggested minimal fix and the driver proved it
# WRONG: a WRAPPED banner's first row loses its leading "  " indent (the
# spec's documented cosmetic side-effect of rebuilding via make_cell/
# fit_spans, not a spans array) so its text starts "!! ...", but an
# UNWRAPPED (single-row) banner KEEPS the "  !! " indent Dashboard::
# _banner_lines bakes in, so its text starts "  !! ...". `^!! ` matches the
# first shape and MISSES the second, undercounting two real banners (one
# wrapped, one not) down to one. Driver-verified against
# tui::DashboardScreen::compose directly.
#
# STRUCTURAL discriminator (primary, authoritative): every cell wrap_line/
# make_cell emits carries a `continuation` flag -- 0 on the first row of a
# wrapped line (and on every single-row fast path), 1 on the rest. So a
# banner-START row is exactly a row with a falsy `continuation`. This
# distinguishes start-vs-continuation by STRUCTURE, not by scanning rendered
# text for a marker that a banner's own (dynamic, tool-surfaced) content could
# coincidentally contain anywhere.
#
# WAS an inference from the first span's ROLE: a start carried the banner's own
# role, a continuation carried the indent role (CONTINUATION_ROLE below). That
# held only while line 0 never had a leading indent of its own, which stopped
# being true when wrap_line was fixed to keep the one-column inset
# overlay_warnings deliberately adds (almanac 20260909-223849-1870). The flag
# exists because appearance turned out to be the wrong thing to read.
#
# TEXT discriminator (secondary, belt-and-braces): `/^\s*!! /` matches BOTH
# accepted first-row shapes above (wrapped "!! ..." and unwrapped
# "  !! ...") and rejects the reviewer's `urgent!!`-mid-line repro (no
# leading "!! " on that row). Used only to CORROBORATE the structural count
# where the marker can physically appear intact in a row -- see the
# $cols < 3 note below for where it cannot, by construction.
#
# WIDTH FLOOR, RULED (red-team follow-up, ledger criterion 4 -- width 1-3
# behavior must be DEFINED, not accidental): driver-verified directly
# against Dashboard::compose_frame that at $cols in (1, 2), wrap_line's
# forced-progress/degenerate-budget path (triggered when the continuation
# + leading indent reservation no longer leaves >=1 content column) drops
# the leading-indent span ENTIRELY -- every row, start AND continuation
# alike, ends up with the banner role as its ONLY/first span. At those two
# widths the structural discriminator cannot distinguish start from
# continuation at all (it counts every row), and the text discriminator
# also cannot corroborate anything (the 3-character "!! " marker cannot fit
# intact in a 1- or 2-column row, torn or not). "How many banners are
# present" is therefore NOT RECOVERABLE from the rendered frame at
# $cols < 3 -- not a test-discriminator gap, an inherent floor of a 1-2
# column banner row. Assertions in this file do not claim a banner-start
# COUNT at $cols < 3; see the width 1/2/3 pinned block below PART (E) for
# what IS asserted there instead (frame validity, no crash).
#
# At $cols == 3 EXACTLY the two discriminators diverge (driver-verified):
# structural is still correct (a 200-row-budget, 2-banner probe at cols=3
# returns struct_starts==2, matching ground truth) because Screen.pm still
# manages to keep line 0's span distinct from continuation lines' spans
# even though the "!! " marker text itself is torn across rows 0/1 (only
# one "!" fits per row before the pad). The text discriminator cannot
# corroborate there (the intact marker literally cannot fit in 3 columns
# either -- "!! " is exactly 3 columns wide with zero room for content).
# Per the ruling above: structural is authoritative; the width 1/2/3 pinned
# block below asserts cols==3 gets a real count (via structural alone) and
# cols==1/2 do not.

    #
    # The PROPERTY is what deserves pinning: there is a contiguous dead band in
    # which a status alert costs nothing, it ends at exactly one row count, and
    # from there on the alert costs exactly one row. So do the scan the comment

    # heights the floor tracks the body). That is a different mechanism from
    # the dead band this block pins, and inside it the differential genuinely
    # does appear -- so the scan has always had to begin above it.
    #
    # 11 was that bound for a two-row chrome. The footer rule made the chrome
    # three rows (2026-08), which moved it to 12, and a remembered 11 turned a

# within THAT SAME TICK — i.e. the scroll tick has >= 2 renders.
#
# Current code (render-before-drain): renders once per tick unconditionally,
# before the drain.  The scroll key is read in the drain AFTER the render, so
# the scroll effect is only visible on tick 2.  Therefore frames_per_tick[1]
# == 1 now.  This test FAILS until the post-drain re-render is added.
#
# Key sequence: [undef, 'DOWN', undef, undef]
#   Tick 0 drain: undef -> drain empty      (no scroll)
#   Tick 1 drain: 'DOWN' then undef -> DOWN drain ends (scroll fires)
#   Tick 2 drain: undef -> drain empty      (no scroll)
#   Tick 3: max_ticks fires (no sleep_for for this tick)
# The 20-event list ensures $activity_max > 0 so the DOWN actually mutates offset.

# E — $prev BASELINE AFTER DOUBLE RENDER
#
# After a scroll tick's double render, the NEXT tick's diff must be computed
# against the re-rendered frame (the second one), NOT the pre-drain frame.
#
# The landmine (scout risk 3): if $prev is NOT updated after the re-render,
# the next tick's render_frame diffs against a stale baseline and emits wrong
# row updates.
#
# Observable proxy: with no state change between tick 1 (scroll) and tick 2
# (no input, no gather), the tick-2 render must be a DIFF render (not a
# full-clear).  If $prev is stale (not updated after the re-render), the
# baseline mismatch causes wrong/extra row repaints.
#
# We assert this at the $out seam level: if the fix is correct, the TOTAL
# number of row-move escapes (\e[R;1H) in the THIRD render (tick-2's single
# render) must be 0 — because the frame content is identical to the re-rendered
# frame from tick 1 (same events, same offset, same state).
#
# Implementation: capture each individual $out call in sequence; inspect the
# third call (index 2) — i.e. render #3 — for row-repaint escapes.
# With the FIX the sequence is: render#1(tick0), render#2(tick1-primary),
# render#3(tick1-scroll-rerender), render#4(tick2) — so render#4 should have 0
# row moves.
# Without the FIX there is no render#3, so render#3==tick2's render, which
# diffs against tick1-primary ($prev still the pre-drain frame) — but since
# offset was also not updated in the render, the frame IS the same as tick0's
# render, so render#3 also has 0 row moves.  This means E cannot produce a
# false-positive failure right now; it passes vacuously (or with the fix).
# We therefore frame E as a NON-regression assertion: the number of row moves
# in the first quiet-tick render after a scroll is 0 — correct with or without
# the fix, but catches a broken $prev update path.
#
# The critical non-vacuous E test: with the fix, frames_per_tick[1] == 2 AND
# the post-scroll tick still shows 0 spurious row repaints.  We capture all
# $out calls individually to inspect.

#    caller that wraps the require in eval and then probes
#    `defined &Dashboard::fit_spans` sees a healthy module and calls in.
#
