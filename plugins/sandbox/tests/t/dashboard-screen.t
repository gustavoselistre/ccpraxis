#!/usr/bin/env perl
# platform: any
# 66 — ORACLE for package 06 (blueprint
# unified-tui-design-system), specs/06-spec.md. Written BLIND
# to any tui/DashboardScreen.pm implementation -- it does not exist yet --
# directly from the spec's numbered observable behaviors (§3) and acceptance
# criteria (§4, AC-B/C/G/S/D/E/F/R/K/L/P). Do NOT weaken an assertion here to
# make a future implementation's life easier.
#
# TODAY'S EXPECTED STATE: plugins/sandbox/scripts/tui/DashboardScreen.pm does
# not exist. Every direct tui::DashboardScreen::* call below is gated on
# $DS_OK and SKIPs cleanly (not a fail, not a compile error) when it is
# false. Dashboard.pm, Theme.pm and the four tui/{Frame,Layout,Meter,Screen}
# modules ALREADY EXIST (shipped by earlier packages) and are called directly
# and unconditionally -- most of THOSE assertions are expected to go RED
# TODAY for a WRONG VALUE (the old dashboard shape: Sandbox panel present,
# breakpoint 100, four duration formats, no density suppression, no
# snapshot_state rendering) rather than a die, which is an equally valid RED
# signal and is exactly what "missing behavior" looks like here.
#
# NON-VACUITY STRATEGY (the priority named by the driver: package 05's oracle
# failed three ways that all looked like coverage -- 423 assertions that
# could not fail, an assertion forbidding what the spec mandated, and a
# fixture widened until a failing assertion passed). This file's answer,
# applied uniformly:
#   1. Count VALUE NONCES (zqxproj7714, zqxctr7714, zqxitem-a..g, zqxevt7714),
#      never label words -- AC-D, AC-K, AC-R.
#   2. Every "== 1" / "== 0" count is preceded by a SEPARATELY NAMED "> 0" /
#      liveness assertion, so "the fact was deleted entirely" fails as its
#      own assertion rather than hiding inside a single already-red one --
#      AC-D4, AC-E2/E5, AC-F3, AC-K1.
#   3. Every negative assertion (unlike/no-row/no-key) is paired with a
#      COUNTER-FIXTURE proving the SAME detector fires on a hand-built input
#      that SHOULD trip it -- AC-D3, AC-E4, AC-G5(local liveness), AC-K2,
#      AC-R2/R3, AC-L4, AC-P5/P6. A guard that cannot fire is not a guard.
#   4. Negatives are scoped to the VALUE side of the ' : ' gutter (AC-E2), or
#      to a bounded token-extraction regex (AC-F1), never to a whole rendered
#      line -- so a correct render (e.g. a role literally named 'state.warn')
#      can never trip a detector built to catch something else.
#   5. Criterion 7 ("no empty right third") is measured with
#      tui::Layout::content_reach, NEVER dead_columns (0 by construction of
#      divide() -- package 05 spec §2.3 says so in as many words).
#   6. Decision 15 (no row-count assertion) is enforced MECHANICALLY, not
#      just promised: AC-P6 below greps this file's OWN source for
#      `is(scalar(@` outside the one whitelisted frame-length identity.
#
# FIVE-ORACLE-CORRECTION CONTEXT (not this file's job, but load-bearing for
# reading its results together with the suite): t/44, t/65, t/41, t/40, t/25
# and t/64 were corrected in the SAME change as this file lands, each
# preserving an old CLAIM while moving its SUBJECT (t/44's AC-20: identical
# -> distinct; t/65's AC-D1: Dashboard has no tui:: -> tui/ has no Dashboard;
# t/41: 4 emoji constants -> Theme-derived; t/40+t/25: breakpoint 100 -> 90;
# t/64's B-E7: Theme::display_width deleted outright, not repointed).
#
# A DOCUMENTED SPEC-TEXT DEFECT (reported per this role's mandate rather than
# silently "fixed to pass"): AC-F1/AC-F2's own superset regex, copied
# character-for-character from the spec, does NOT match its own AC-F2 demo
# string '42 minutes' (verified: 'min'/'mins' are listed but not
# 'minute'/'minutes', so the trailing 'utes' fails the (?![\w]) lookahead).
# The unit-word list below is extended (minute/minutes/hour/hours added)
# so AC-F2's own explicit claim actually holds; this does not change what
# AC-F1 can capture from THIS file's own fixture (nothing in it is spelled
# "N minutes"), and does not touch the regex's other, load-bearing property:
# it also cannot capture tui::DashboardScreen's OWN compact grammar
# (\d+h\d{2}m / \d+d\d{2}h) at all -- by design, that grammar is verified
# directly against DURATION_RE() (AC-F1/F4), not via this catcher, whose job
# is to surface the THREE outlawed formats (HH:MM:SS, "Xh Ym Zs", bare
# English unit words) if any of them leak into a rendered frame.

    # This asserted that any width at or above tui::Layout's two-column
    # breakpoint (90) puts two panel titles on one row. That held while the
    # paired panels declared no minimum width. It does not now: the operator
    # reorganised the grid so Resources sits beside Run, and Resources needs 75
    # columns (a label, a gauge, a percent and a used/free/total triple) against
    # Run's 44 -- so a band can hold both only once the main region has ~119.
    #
    # Between 90 and 118 the panels STACK, and that is the correct outcome: the
    # alternative is rendering one of them too narrow to read. tui::Layout only
    # promises to CONSIDER two columns above the breakpoint, not to achieve them
    # regardless of what the panels need.

# NO_COLOR REGRESSION (fix-batch item 1 -- the point of this batch). Driver
# diagnosis, verified directly: NO_COLOR=1 still paints recent_events'
# activity-event rows in colour. Cause: recent_events builds glyph/body
# spans with event_style's LEGACY role names ('good'/'bad'/'warn'/...), and
# Dashboard::sgr_for_role only routes THEME role names (Theme::roles()'
# nine) through Theme::sgr (which honours NO_COLOR) -- a legacy name falls
# through to a hard-coded escape that honours nothing. Fix under test
# (implementer, concurrent): recent_events maps each legacy role through
# tui::DashboardScreen::theme_role(...) at the span, exactly as the time
# span already does (t/41's TIME_ROLE).
#
# Spec S5's degradation table is explicit that NO_COLOR strips COLOUR only
# -- attribute-only escapes (dim \e[2m, bold \e[1m) are CORRECT and must
# still appear. So the detector below is scoped to COLOUR SGR parameters
# specifically (foreground 30-37/90-97, background 40-47/100-107, or an
# extended 38/48 introducer), never "any escape at all" -- asserting the
