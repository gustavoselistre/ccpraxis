# TestSandbox.pm creates real `sleep 600` probe containers and relied on a
# single END block to remove them. END does not run on an unhandled signal, and
# this suite is routinely run under `timeout` (project CLAUDE.md mandates it for
# anything that could reach launcher.pl) and interrupted by hand. Every such
# abort leaked a container, and because names are PID-tagged the leftovers
# accumulated silently instead of colliding — the operator eventually found a
# pile of them in `podman ps -a`.
#
# These tests pin the reaping RULE (pure, no container runtime needed) and the
# registration of the signal handlers. They deliberately do NOT create real
# containers: the rule is where the bugs live, and a test that spawns podman
# would be gated on a runtime this file does not need.
