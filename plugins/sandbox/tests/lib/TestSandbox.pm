# Mirrors the MSYS2-defense pattern from launcher.pl: disable MSYS argv
# path conversion, winify host paths upfront, and translate `-v` mount
# specs into `--mount type=bind|volume,source=,target=` to defeat the
# colon-as-PATH-list mangling on Git-for-Windows perl. Without these the
# test harness silently corrupts every podman command on Windows.
#
# All resources (containers, volumes, temp dirs) are tagged with the
# current PID + a counter so concurrent runs don't collide. Cleanup is
# three-layered: an END block for normal exit and `die`, signal handlers
# for the abort paths END does NOT cover (Ctrl-C, `timeout`), and a
# load-time sweep of containers whose creating PID is already dead, which
# is the only layer that can recover from a SIGKILL or an earlier run.
# See the "Orphan reaping" block below for why all three are needed.

# Orphan reaping — why this exists, and why END was never enough.
#
# The header of this file used to claim the END block "cleans up reliably even
# if a test aborts mid-flight". That is true for `die` and for a normal exit,
# and FALSE for the way these tests most often actually stop: a signal. Perl
# does not run END blocks when the process takes an unhandled SIGINT/SIGTERM/
# SIGHUP, and this suite is routinely run under `timeout` (project CLAUDE.md
# mandates it for anything that could reach launcher.pl) and interrupted by
# hand with Ctrl-C. Every one of those paths left `sleep 600` probe containers
# behind, and because each run tags names with its own PID they accumulate
# silently rather than colliding — the operator found a pile of them in
# `podman ps -a` long after the runs were gone.
#
# Two layers, because neither alone is sufficient:
#   1. Signal handlers, so the common abort paths clean up their OWN containers
#      the way an ordinary exit does. Handlers re-raise with the default
#      disposition afterwards, so the exit status still reports the signal
#      rather than silently becoming 0.
#   2. A sweeper for containers whose creating process is already gone. Layer 1
#      cannot help a run that was SIGKILLed, that crashed the interpreter, or
#      that predates this change. The name carries the creating PID, so
#      liveness is decidable without any extra state: a test container whose
#      PID is not alive owns nothing and is safe to remove. A LIVE PID's
#      containers are never touched, which is what keeps concurrent runs safe.
