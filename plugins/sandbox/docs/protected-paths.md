# The protected-path guard

## 1. What this guard does

`claude-sandbox` refuses to open a project directory that overlaps anything Claude Code has
installed on this machine, because the sandbox bind-mounts the target directory read-write into the
container. Two holes this guard closes: `~/.claude` (Claude Code's own configuration home) and
`~/.claude/ccpraxis/plugins` (the marketplace directory the live ccpraxis install is loaded from).
Before this guard existed, sandboxing either of those handed the container write access to
credentials, session transcripts and the running plugin tree.

## 2. Where the protected roots come from

Four sources contribute protected roots, plus one user-editable list:

| # | source | contributes |
|---|---|---|
| a | every `installLocation` recorded in `known_marketplaces.json` | `marketplace-install` roots |
| b | every `source.path` of a `directory`-source entry in the same registry | `marketplace-source` roots |
| c | the Claude home: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `$HOME/.claude` and `$USERPROFILE/.claude` — **all three
    unioned**, never a precedence chain | `claude-home` roots |
| d | the ccpraxis live install anchor, from **two independent sources**: the `ccpraxis-local`
    registry entry (the registry entry is what `live_install_dir` resolves), **and** the anchor the
    launcher derives from its own `abs_path(__FILE__)` and passes in as `live_install_hint` | the
    `ccpraxis-install` root |
| e | the user-configured extra list (see section 6 below) | `user-configured` roots |

The registry the launcher treats as **authoritative** is pinned to
`$HOME/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json` — the same file the launcher uses everywhere else, so
this guard and the rest of the launcher can never disagree about what is installed. The guard
*additionally* looks for the same relative filename under the other home candidates it trusts as
**sources**, and unions whatever it finds. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is deliberately **not** one of those
candidates: passing it can add a protected root, but it cannot make the guard read a file — see "Which
home candidates may name a source" below.

### Where the user-configured extra list is read from (`q05`)

**`~/.claude/ccpraxis-protected-paths.json`, from the authoritative home, and nowhere else.**
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` does **not** relocate it.

Earlier help text advertised it as `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/ccpraxis-protected-paths.json`,
and `q05` initially "fixed" the code to match that promise. That was wrong, and `q03`'s `t/53`
(AC-57/AC-58) caught it. The corrected promise is what shipped.

The reasoning matters, because the mistake is an easy one to repeat. It is tempting to argue that the
extra list is **add-only** — it can only ever contribute *more* protected roots — and therefore that
letting an environment variable name it fails safe. That is true of the list's **contents** and false
of its **location**. Redirecting *where* the list is read from means the user's real list is never
read at all: **fewer** protected roots, **fewer** refusals, failing **open**. That is exactly the
"silently void the user list" failure `q03`'s Decision #5 pinned this path to prevent, and it is why
`q04` dropped `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (and `USERPROFILE`) from the trusted **source** set, with
measurements.

So the asymmetry in this document is deliberate and holds in both directions:

| variable | may contribute a protected **root** | may name a **source** the guard reads |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | yes | **no** |
| `HOME` | yes (hardened via the authoritative-home seam) | yes |
| `USERPROFILE` | yes | **no** |

### The `HOME` residue is closed (`q05`, supersedes `q04`'s "Known limitation")

`q04` recorded a known limitation: the launcher built `registry_path` and `extra_list_path` from
`$HOME/.claude` *before* the authoritative-home seam existed, so redirecting `HOME` still dropped
every `marketplace-install` / `marketplace-source` root and the user's own extra list. That residue is
now closed — both keys are derived **through** the seam at the call site, so a redirected `HOME`
cannot move them.

`USERPROFILE` is hardened in the seam **only when `HOME` is absent or empty** — precisely the case
where `home_dir()` falls through to it and it would otherwise move the whole protected set. When
`HOME` is present, `USERPROFILE` is an ordinary key and passes through unchanged, which is what
`q03`'s AC-54 asserts and what `q04`'s source-set design assumes.

**Every root is resolved, not merely normalised.** Each candidate root is put through the same
resolution the target already gets (the launcher `abs_path`s the project path before asking), so a
protected root reached through a symlink is matched rather than missed. If `~/.claude` is a symlink
to `/data/claude`, the root recorded is `/data/claude`, and asking to sandbox `/data/claude` refuses.
Resolution happens once, when the root is ingested — before the bare-root and home rejections below,
so a symlink pointing at `/` or at your home cannot slip past them, and before de-duplication, so
two symlinks to one real directory collapse into one root instead of two.

**Redirecting `HOME` no longer shrinks the protected set.** Launching with `HOME` pointing somewhere
else used to read a different (or absent) registry and silently lose every `marketplace-install` and
`marketplace-source` root derived from it. The registry and extra-list *source* is now a **candidate
set**, not a single path: the guard looks for `plugins/known_marketplaces.json` and
`ccpraxis-protected-paths.json` under every home candidate it trusts as a source and **unions** every
root it finds. An explicitly supplied registry path (the launcher always supplies one) is still read,
and is *added to* rather than replaced. A redirected `HOME` can therefore only ever add roots, never
remove them, and over-refusal is the safe direction. The `ccpraxis-install` root is additionally
supplied by the launcher's own `abs_path(__FILE__)` anchor, which no environment variable can move.

**Which home candidates may name a source.** Contributing a *root* and being trusted as a *source* are
two different levels of trust, and the guard separates them:

| home candidate | may contribute a `claude-home` root | may have a registry / extra list read out of it |
|---|---|---|
| `$HOME/.claude` | yes | **yes** |
| the home the OS itself reports (`getpwuid`, environment-independent) | yes | **yes** |
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (a directory named verbatim by one variable) | yes | no |
| `$USERPROFILE/.claude` | yes | no |

The asymmetry is the point. A candidate that only contributes a root can, at worst, over-refuse
*itself* — a bounded, self-inflicted cost, and the safe direction. A candidate trusted as a *source*
contributes whatever paths its file names, which is unbounded: pointing `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` at a
directory you can write and planting a one-line JSON file used to be enough to protect `/home` and
refuse **every project on the machine**, with no override to undo it (section 8). The same fan-out also
resurrected a *stale* registry left behind under a former Claude home and refused a legitimate ccpraxis
development clone — no attacker required, just a user who had moved their configuration home.

*Residue, stated honestly:* the environment-independent home probe is the POSIX passwd database. It
works on Linux, macOS **and** Git-for-Windows/MSYS2 perl (a Cygwin derivative, where the passwd
database is implemented) — the earlier claim in this document that the mitigation was POSIX-only was
wrong. On **native Windows perl** (`$^O eq 'MSWin32'`) there is no `getpwuid` and no PowerShell probe
is shipped, so there the candidate set is only as wide as `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `%USERPROFILE%` and
`HOME` make it; `%USERPROFILE%` is the one a Windows process is least likely to have redirected, and
the `abs_path(__FILE__)` anchor still holds regardless. The probe is also only adopted when the
`.claude` directory it points at actually exists, so it invents no phantom roots.

**A root that swallows your home directory is rejected.** One malformed `installLocation` that climbs
out of its directory can land exactly on `$HOME` — or on `/home`, `/Users`, `C:/Users`, which contain
it — and either way *every* project on the machine becomes a descendant of a protected root. Since
there is no override (section 8), that is an unrecoverable outage rather than an inconvenience. Such a
root is dropped with a `root-home-rejected` warning. Three limits on this rejection, all deliberate:

- It matches your home **exactly, or strictly contains it** — never a *descendant* of it. `~/.claude`
  *is* a descendant of your home and remains the guard's highest-value protected root.
- It applies only to roots that came from **content**: a registry `installLocation`, a
  `directory`-source path, or an entry in your extra list. A root the guard derived itself
  (`claude-home`, `ccpraxis-install`) is **never** dropped this way. The comparison uses your home as
  read from the environment, so allowing it to delete a derived root would have made one environment
  variable a delete button for the guard's most valuable root — an override in all but name.
- It drops one candidate, never the whole set: every other root keeps protecting normally.

The Claude home is a **union**, not a precedence chain: if `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `$HOME/.claude` and
`$USERPROFILE/.claude` all resolve to different paths, all three are protected. A chain would let
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/tmp/decoy` remove the real `~/.claude` from the protected set entirely — exactly
the kind of environment-variable-shaped escape hatch this guard forbids (see section 8).

A bare filesystem root (`/`, `C:/`) or a bare drive is **never accepted as a protected root** — it is
rejected with a `root-bare-rejected` warning wherever it would otherwise be added as one. Targeting a
bare root or the user's home directory itself is instead handled directly as a `drive-root` /
`user-home` reason code (see section 4).

## 3. The three relations (plus "unrelated")

Every protected root is compared against the target path and classified as one of:

- **exact** — the path you gave IS this protected root. Example: target `/home/u/.claude`, root
  `/home/u/.claude`.
- **descendant** — the path you gave is INSIDE this protected root. Example: target
  `/home/u/.claude/plugins`, root `/home/u/.claude`.
- **ancestor** — the path you gave CONTAINS this protected root. Example: target `/opt`, root
  `/opt/ext-install`.
- **unrelated** — neither path contains the other. A target that is `unrelated` to every protected
  root launches normally; this is the common case for ordinary projects.

`ancestor` matters because `~/.claude` contains every installed marketplace: without an `ancestor`
relation, a rule that only checked `exact`/`descendant` would leave the single highest-value target
— `~/.claude` itself, when reached indirectly via a parent directory — unprotected.

## 4. Reason codes

| reason code | what it means | what to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| `ccpraxis-install` | the target is (or is inside) the live ccpraxis installation | work in a separate clone, `git clone --no-hardlinks` |
| `claude-home` | the target is (or is inside) Claude Code's configuration home | open the specific project directory you meant to work in |
| `marketplace-install` | the target is (or is inside) an installed plugin marketplace's `installLocation` | open the specific project directory, or clone the repository containing it |
| `marketplace-source` | the target is (or is inside) a `directory`-source marketplace's source path | open the specific project directory, or clone the repository containing it |
| `user-configured` | the target is (or is inside) an entry in the user's extra protected-paths list | open the specific project directory, or remove the entry from the list |
| `drive-root` | the target is a bare filesystem root | open the specific project directory you meant to work in |
| `user-home` | the target IS the user's home directory | open the specific project directory you meant to work in |

`drive-root` and `user-home` are self-codes: they describe the target itself, not a collision with
an installed root, so they get their own wording rather than being reported as "contains a
marketplace" (which is nearly always technically true for `/` and `$HOME`, but useless advice).

### Root-rejection codes

These are **not** refusal reasons — they never appear as the reason a launch was refused, and never
as a root's `reason`. They are warnings emitted while *building* the protected set, telling you a
candidate root was thrown away or could not be resolved. They arrive on STDERR in the section 6
format.

| code | what it means | what to do about it |
|---|---|---|
| `root-bare-rejected` | a source offered a bare filesystem root (`/`, `C:/`) as a protected root, which would refuse every project on the volume | find the source named in the warning — usually a malformed `installLocation` in `known_marketplaces.json`, or a `"/"` entry in your extra list — and correct it |
| `root-home-rejected` | a registry entry or extra-list entry offered your **home directory itself, or a directory containing it** (`/home`, `C:/Users`), as a protected root — which would refuse every project you own. Only content-derived roots are rejected this way, and never a *descendant*, so `~/.claude` stays protected | fix the offending entry named in the warning; an `installLocation` with `../..` segments that climbs out of the plugins directory is the usual cause |
| `root-unresolved` | a root could not be resolved to a real location — in practice a **dangling symlink**: the link is there, what it points at is not. The root is **kept** and still enforced, at its literal path | repoint or remove the symlink; until then the root is matched literally, so a target reached by a *different* path to the same directory may not be recognised |

A path that simply **does not exist** is not reported as `root-unresolved` — see section 6.

## 5. Which reason you get when several match

When more than one protected root relates to the target, the guard picks exactly one `(reason,
root, relation)` triple, in this order:

1. **Self-codes beat everything.** If the target itself is a bare filesystem root or the user's home
   directory, that fires immediately — `drive-root` or `user-home` — regardless of what marketplaces
   or configuration happen to live underneath it.
2. **Among the roots that do match, the lowest relation class wins:** `exact` beats `descendant`
   beats `ancestor`. "You are inside X" is a stronger, more honest statement than "you contain Y".
3. **Within a relation class, the module's own root order wins** — ascending reason rank
   (`ccpraxis-install` < `claude-home` < `marketplace-install` < `marketplace-source` <
   `user-configured`), then ascending path order.

Two worked examples:

- Target `~/.claude`: this is `exact` against the `claude-home` root, but only `ancestor` against
  the `ccpraxis-install` root (since `~/.claude/ccpraxis` is underneath it). Rule 2 picks the
  `exact` relation, so the reason is `claude-home`, not `ccpraxis-install`.
- Target `~/.claude/ccpraxis/plugins/sandbox`: this is `descendant` of all three of
  `ccpraxis-install`, `claude-home` and `marketplace-install` roots that contain it. Rule 3 breaks
  the tie by reason rank, so the reason is `ccpraxis-install` (rank 0), the lowest of the three.

## 6. When a source is broken

If a source cannot be read or parsed (missing registry file, malformed JSON, wrong shape, a
hostile/dying registry entry), the guard prints one line per problem to STDERR:

```
claude-sandbox: WARNING: protected-path source [<code>]: <detail>
```

capped at 10 lines, with one overflow line if there are more than 10 problems, followed by exactly
one final line naming how many protected roots the guard is still enforcing. A broken source **never
shrinks a refusal**: every root that did resolve is still matched and enforced exactly as if the
broken source did not exist. Conversely, a broken source **alone is never fatal** — a machine with no
`known_marketplaces.json` (a fresh Claude Code install with no marketplace registered) still launches
normally for an ordinary project; it just loses the `marketplace-*` and `ccpraxis-install` roots that
source would have contributed, and says so loudly.

**When a root cannot be resolved.** Resolution (section 2) can fail for an individual root. When it
does, the guard **degrades to the root's literal path and warns** (`root-unresolved`), and the root
stays in the protected set and stays enforced. It is never dropped: dropping it would *shrink* the
protected set, which is the one direction this guard is not allowed to fail in. The only thing lost is
the ability to recognise that root under a *different* spelling of the same directory.

**The case this actually reports is a dangling symlink** — the root is a symlink and its target is
gone. That is the failure you can act on (repoint the link), and it is worth telling you about, because
a dangling `~/.claude` means the root is being enforced at a path that does not exist. If you use
`stow`, `chezmoi` or `yadm` and have moved your dotfiles, this is the warning you will see. A symlink
that resolves normally is not reported at all: it simply resolves, which is the whole point of
section 2.

**A path that does not exist is not an unresolvable path.** Protected roots routinely name
directories that are simply absent — a marketplace you uninstalled, an extra-list entry for a
checkout you have not made yet. Those are kept silently, with **no** warning: there is nothing to
resolve, nothing is broken, and warning about them would nag on every otherwise-clean launch. An
absent path that is not a symlink is therefore never a `root-unresolved`.

*One residue, stated honestly:* a path that runs *through* a dangling symlink (`~/.claude/plugins`
where `~/.claude` is the dangling link) is treated as merely absent and stays silent — it is not itself
a symlink. The link at the top of the chain is what gets reported.

## 7. Using the extra list

You can protect additional paths yourself by listing them at:

```
${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/ccpraxis-protected-paths.json
```

**One caveat, and it matters if you set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`.** The launcher pins the list it reads to
`$HOME/.claude/ccpraxis-protected-paths.json`, and the guard will not read a list out of a directory
named by `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` — that is section 2's "may not name a source" rule, and it is what stops a
writable `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` from adding protected roots you never asked for. So on a machine with
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` set, put the file in `~/.claude` (or in the home your OS itself reports, which the
guard also checks) rather than in the redirected directory.

The file, if present, must be a **JSON array of absolute path strings**, for example:

```json
[
  "/home/u/work/some-shared-checkout",
  "C:/Development/company-secrets"
]
```

Every entry becomes a `user-configured` protected root. An **absent file is an empty list and not an
error** — nothing to configure means nothing extra is protected. A **malformed file (not valid JSON,
or not a JSON array) is an error**, surfaced as a `claude-sandbox: WARNING: ...` line same as any
other broken source (see section 6); it does not block the launch of an unrelated project, and it
does not relax any refusal already in effect. The list is machine-scoped (it lives in your Claude home,
not per-project), so one list serves every project on the machine. An entry that resolves to a bare
filesystem root is rejected with a `root-bare-rejected` warning rather than being accepted as a
protected root, and one that resolves to your home directory — or to a directory containing it — is
rejected with `root-home-rejected`, since either would refuse every project you own.

## 8. There is no override

No flag, no environment variable, no interactive prompt bypasses this guard. If a refusal is wrong,
the fix is to correct the detector
(`plugins/sandbox/scripts/ProtectedPaths.pm`) and its oracles
(`plugins/sandbox/tests/t/protected-paths.t`,
`plugins/sandbox/tests/t/refuse-protected-paths.t`) — never to teach the launcher a bypass.

## 9. Relationship to the in-place refusal

An older, narrower check (`CcpraxisWorkCopy::workcopy_route`) still runs immediately after this
guard, as a fail-safe. It also consults the launcher's own `__FILE__`-derived anchor for the live
ccpraxis install, so it still refuses to sandbox the live install in place even on a machine where
the marketplace registry cannot be read and this guard's `ccpraxis-install` root is therefore
missing. See `plugins/sandbox/docs/working-on-ccpraxis.md` for the clone workflow that refusal
points you to.
