package BackpackApproval;
# Per-item, machine-local approval memory for backpack items — the launcher's
# install gate (#21). Backpack install/verify commands run AS ROOT in the
# container, so the user approves each item before it runs. Approval is keyed by
# item identity (category:name) AND a content hash of the commands that will
# execute, so:
#   * an UNCHANGED, already-approved item is never re-prompted, and
#   * a CHANGED item (its install/verify edited) re-prompts — you approved
#     specific commands, not just a name.
# Newly added items are the only ones reviewed on a later launch.
#
# State lives machine-local under .launcher/ (like the older whole-file trust
# hash it replaces): "I trust these commands on THIS machine" is a per-machine
# security decision. backpack.json itself stays the shared, steward-synced source
# of truth — only `remove` mutates it.
#
# PURE module: no console I/O, no spawning. The launcher owns the interactive
# review and the install; this owns the identity/hash/partition/store logic so it
# can be held accountable by the test suite.

# item_key($item) -> "category:name" — the stable identity used as the store key.
#
# The join is INJECTIVE: a literal ':' or '\' inside either component is escaped
# first, so distinct items can never collide on one key. Without that,
# {category => 'npm-global', name => 'a:b'} and {category => 'npm-global:a',
# name => 'b'} both rendered as 'npm-global:a:b'. backpack.pl de-duplicates on
# "$category\0$name" and only WARNS about an unknown category, so both survive
# validation and reach the store together.
#
# Found by the package 08 red-team on 2026-08-08, which drove the collision to a
# wrong-item deletion in the launch-time triage screen. That call site is now
# keyed by position, so the destructive path is closed there — but the store
# ITSELF was still collapsing the two, and `forget` on one silently deleted the
# other's approval. That direction is fail-safe (the item returns to pending and
# is re-reviewed) rather than destructive, which is why it is a correctness fix
# rather than an emergency.
#
# Escaping rather than switching the delimiter to "\0" is deliberate. This string
# is the on-disk key in backpack-approvals.json, so changing the rendering of
# ORDINARY items would invalidate every stored approval and silently re-prompt
# the operator for commands they had already reviewed. Escaping leaves every key
# without a ':' or '\' in its components byte-identical — which is all of them in
# practice — and changes only the pathological ones that were broken anyway.

#                 legacy file may still carry one; it is never executed, so it is
#                 excluded here too — a stray version must not affect approval.
#   * rationale — prose shown to the human; editing it must not invalidate a
#                 prior command approval.
