package RunState;
# RunState.pm — pure orchestrator/run-state summarizer for the dashboard.
#
# Walks a blueprints root (`<project>/.ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/`) and
# builds one summary struct per blueprint that has a decodable
# `runs/registry.json`, cross-referencing the run markers (`.orchestrator`,
# `.paused`, `.shutdown`), the `needs-you/` decision queue, and each
# package's ledger frontmatter `status:` line (authoritative over the
# registry's own `status`) — spec `07-run-state-panel-spec.md`, s10 of
# blueprint sandbox-butler-overhaul.
#
# Pure, in the SessionFilter sense: no console I/O (no print/warn/die), no
# spawning, no writes, no globals mutated. Read-only, and only under the
# root/dir it is handed. Total: every public sub returns its declared type
# for every input, including undef, refs where scalars are expected, hostile
# bytes, symlinks, unreadable files and malformed JSON — nothing propagates
# an exception; all decoding happens inside eval {}.
#
# Discovery uses opendir/readdir — glob is forbidden anywhere in this file —
# so a project path containing spaces or non-ASCII bytes (André) is safe.
# Nothing is exported; callers use fully-qualified names
# (RunState::summarize(...)), exactly as launcher.pl calls SessionFilter:: /
# BackpackApproval::. No time()/localtime/gmtime/clock read.
#
# 04-run-panel-ledger-truth (Decision 3): RunState performs NO process probe
# itself and contains no `kill` -- it delegates coordinator-PID liveness to a
# caller-injected coderef, $RunState::PID_ALIVE, installed by launcher.pl
# (the impure kill(0,...) syscall lives there, never here). RunState is total
# against a prober that dies, returns undef, or returns anything hostile at
# all -- see _pid_state(). Progress (packages_total/packages_done/
# current_package) is derived from packages/*.md ledgers whenever at least
# one candidate ledger exists; runs/registry.json is consulted only as the
# per-package status fallback and, after a liveness check, for
# running_coordinators.
#
# See specs/07-run-state-panel-spec.md (S2) for the full field-by-field
# contract; the struct's 11-key set is CLOSED and stable (s11 depends on it).

# t07-needs-you-lifecycle. Operator, verbatim: "the TUI for GSA says 'needs
# you: 1 decision waiting' despite the agent that was working on it doesn't
# really have anything that needs my attention?"
#
# COUNTING FILES IN A DIRECTORY IS NOT A LIFECYCLE, and that was the whole
# defect. Eight scripts write into runs/needs-you/ and exactly ONE narrow path
# clears them (bp-answer-decision.pl's clear_pkg_decisions, and only for a
# direct package reset). Everything else -- a package that finished normally, a
# run that ended, a fleet question the operator resolved some other way --
# leaves its file behind forever, and the panel keeps asking.
#
# THE FAILURE DIRECTION IS NOT SYMMETRIC (done-criterion 4). A decision wrongly
# kept is a panel that nags. A decision wrongly dropped is a human who is never
# asked. So every rule below is conservative BY CONSTRUCTION: a record is live
# unless something demonstrably settled it, and every unreadable, malformed,
# ambiguous or unrecognised case counts as live.
#
# A decision is SETTLED only when the thing it was blocking is demonstrably
# finished:
#
#   1. Its package's ledger says `done` or `dropped`. That is not a new
#      judgement -- it is the SAME set bp-orchestrator.pl's %DECISION_VALIDITY
#      already uses to REFUSE FILING one of these. If a package being done
#      means "do not file this", then a decision filed earlier and now done is
#      equally moot. The symmetry is the argument.
#
#   2. Or the RUN ITSELF is over: no live orchestrator and no .paused marker.
#      A decision blocking a run that has finished cannot still be blocking it.
#      This is what covers the fleet-family kinds (reauth, contract-drift,
#      broken-env), which name no real package.
#
# WHY NOT SIMPLY "no .paused means settled": some kinds are filed WITHOUT
# pausing the run, so a rule keyed on .paused alone would read them as settled
# the instant they were written -- silently dropping a real pending decision,
# which is precisely the direction done-criterion 4 forbids. Requiring the run
# to be over as well is what makes rule 2 safe.

#
# Operator, on the run that forced this: "we use way too many instances of ..."
# -- no, the one that matters here: "It stopped an overnight run blocking on me
# to answer some random bullshit question that is an implementation detail."
#
# Every queued escalation carries a `category`. Two of them (product,
# operator-action) are the ones bp-resolve.pl may never decide: they leave the
# queue only when a human reads them. The rest are handed to the escalation
# resolver, which either acts or re-tags -- nobody needs to be woken for those.
#
# THE DEFAULT IS STILL THE OPERATOR, and deliberately so. A record whose
# category is missing, unreadable or unrecognised counts as operator-owned,
# because nothing will ever triage it: bp-orchestrator.pl's resolver dispatch
# filters on exactly the triageable set, so an unrecognised category is a record
# no agent will ever look at again. Counting it as "someone else's problem"
# would be the one failure this module's own header forbids -- "a decision

# (summarize_dir), not here. 04-run-panel-ledger-truth consolidated

# to eliminate, on a much larger scale than the original oversized-ledger
# defect). An over-cap ledger set must now cause summarize_dir to return
# undef DIRECTLY -- see there.
#
# A directory entry is a candidate ledger iff: the name does not begin with

# real ledger is never silently dropped from the denominator (that would
