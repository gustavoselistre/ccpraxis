# keep-awake.ps1 -- hold a Windows wake-lock for as long as THIS process lives,
# and NO LONGER than its lease.
#
# Started/killed by the sandbox dashboard's keep-awake (B5, KeepAwake.pm) and by
# butler's bp-keepawake.pl, gated by the orchestrator's busy-lease: spawned only
# while there is active work or a pending auto-resume, killed when idle.
#
# The host perl has no Win32::API, so we assert SetThreadExecutionState via
# P/Invoke from PowerShell. ES_CONTINUOUS ties the request to the calling thread,
# so the lock is released automatically the moment this process is killed -- no
# explicit "undo" call is needed (which is exactly why we run it as a dedicated
# child whose lifetime == the wake-lock's lifetime).
#
# We request ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED. That was the whole request as of 2026-09-17;
# it no longer is -- see the EXECUTION POWER REQUEST block further down, which
# also holds a PowerRequestExecutionRequired Power Request alongside it,
# acquired right after SetThreadExecutionState succeeds and released from the
# `finally` block below (package 01, Decision 1).
#
# THIS BLOCK USED TO CLAIM ES_DISPLAY_REQUIRED WAS "the load-bearing flag on
# Modern Standby (S0 Low Power Idle) machines", on the reasoning that "those
# systems enter connected standby when the display turns off". MEASURED, and the
# premise is false on this class of machine. An eight-hour unattended run was
# lost, and Windows named the cause itself:
#
#   Kernel-Power 506, 06:04:57 local
#   "The system is entering connected standby.  Reason: Idle Timeout."
#
# IDLE TIMEOUT -- not display-off. The display request was held and refreshing on
# its normal two-minute cadence when that fired. So the flag was blocking a
# trigger that was not the trigger, while costing a lit screen through every
# unattended night. Dropped at the operator's instruction.
#
# WHAT THE REQUESTS ACTUALLY DO HERE, from `powercfg /requests` taken elevated
# while a lock was held:
#
#   DISPLAY:    [PROCESS] ...\powershell.exe     <- was registered, worked
#   SYSTEM:     [PROCESS] ...\powershell.exe     <- registered, works
#   EXECUTION:  None.                            <- the gap that mattered
#
# SetThreadExecutionState was never being ignored: Windows had both requests.
# Neither of them keeps a PROCESS RUNNING once the system is in connected
# standby -- that is PowerRequestExecutionRequired, which has no ES_* flag and
# cannot be expressed through this API at all. Work continued INSIDE standby for
# nearly four hours on DISPLAY+SYSTEM alone, then Desktop Activity Moderation
# suspended it.
#
# WE DO NOW HOLD AN EXECUTION POWER REQUEST TOO (package 01, Decision 1), and
# this paragraph used to argue against doing so -- superseded, not deleted, so
# the reasoning that led here stays legible. The gap this closes is real:
# PowerRequestExecutionRequired protects the CALLING PROCESS only, and one held
# by this PowerShell does nothing for the launcher, the orchestrator, or the
# agent process doing the actual work -- but this PowerShell is not incidental:
# it is the dedicated process whose lifetime the wake-lock already binds to
# (see the header above), so an execution request pinned to IT is exactly the
# shape the earlier reasoning was missing. The containerised case is still
# covered differently, since everything inside the WSL VM is one process
# (`vmmem`) to Windows.
#
# THE ACTUAL FIX IS TO LEAVE THE REGIME: disabling Modern Standby
# (PlatformAoAcOverride) restores classic S3 sleep, where ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED is
# correct AND sufficient, because S3 is exactly the idle timer it targets. That
# is a machine-level change and is the operator's to make; this script is
# already correct for that world and costs nothing in the meantime.
#
# Caveats no software request can beat: closing the lid or the power button still
# forces standby, and battery power policy may override -- for a long unattended
# run, keep the machine on AC.
#
# THE LEASE, added 2026-08-14. Before this, the body was
# `while ($true) { Start-Sleep -Seconds 3600 }` with no owner check and no
# expiry: the ONLY release was the parent killing us. That fails in exactly the
# case that matters -- the parent dying unexpectedly (crash, forced restart, WSL
# VM kill, a session torn down mid-run). An orphan then held ES_DISPLAY_REQUIRED
# and kept the machine awake INDEFINITELY, with nothing left that knew to reap
# it. The -PidFile reaping path only helps if some LATER launcher happens to run
# in the same project and finds the file. The operator asked the right question:
# these should be refreshed against a timeout threshold.
#
# So the pid file is now a HEARTBEAT as well as an identity: the owning side
# touches it while it still wants the lock (see bp-keepawake.pl's apply(), which
# refreshes it on the very tick that finds a live lock and leaves it alone). We
# poll, and exit when any of
#   * the pid file is GONE      -- someone released us deliberately,
#   * it has not been touched within -LeaseSeconds -- nobody is left who wants
#     it (with a verified -OwnerWinPid: only if that owner has also exited), or
#   * the verified owner has exited (RELEASE reason=owner-gone).
# Exiting drops the wake-lock automatically, because ES_CONTINUOUS is bound to
# this thread. Worst case an abandoned lock now costs one lease period, not "until
# the next reboot". That promise holds for EVERY caller: -LeaseSeconds 0 without
# a verified owner falls back to a 60s lease (LEASE-FALLBACK), and with one the
# lock ends at the latest one poll after that owner exits. The one hold with no
# time bound is a verified owner that stays alive -- deliberate (Decision 3).
#
# -PidFile: we write our own Windows PID here at startup and remove it on exit,
# so a launcher that crashed while we were running can still reap us by pid.
#
# ASCII ONLY. This file previously carried em-dashes with no BOM; PowerShell 5.1
# reads a BOM-less file as CP1252, where the UTF-8 bytes for an em-dash decode to
# a sequence containing 0x94 -- a smart quote, which PowerShell treats as a STRING
# DELIMITER. It was harmless only because those bytes sat inside comments. Do not
# reintroduce non-ASCII here.
# THE LEASE IS OPT-IN, and that is deliberate. It is only safe for a caller that
# actually REFRESHES the heartbeat; a caller that spawns us and then never
# touches the pid file would have its lock reaped mid-run, letting the machine
# sleep during exactly the long unattended run the lock exists to protect.
#
# Today: butler's bp-keepawake.pl refreshes on every director tick and passes a
# lease. launcher.pl's dashboard holder does NOT refresh, so it passes no lease
# and instead names itself with -OwnerWinPid (its WINDOWS pid, read from
# /proc/$$/winpid; Decision 16): it holds until the launcher kills it, removes
# the pid file, or dies. If the launcher cannot read its WINPID it omits the
# flag and gets the bounded 60s fallback, never an unowned indefinite hold. Do
# not "helpfully" give that path a finite lease without also giving it a
# refresher (its heartbeat loop is the obvious home).
#
# -OwnerWinPid (package 02): the owner's WINDOWS pid. When given, a stale
# heartbeat no longer means "abandoned" by itself -- a live owner is QUIET and
# the lock is held (HOLD-QUIET); an exited owner is GONE and the lock is released
# at once (RELEASE reason=owner-gone). With -LeaseSeconds 0 and a verified owner,
# the owner's exit is the only automatic release; an unverifiable owner means
# OWNER-UNVERIFIABLE and the fallback lease. See the pinning block below the
# clamps.

#
#   (a) the request WAS held and Windows slept anyway, or

# Neither is recoverable after the fact. run.md carries no timestamps, the pid
