#
# Subcommands (see `help` for details):
#   discover                List available custom skills as JSON.
#   discover-plugins        List plugins for this project as JSON (with project/suggestion partition).
#   discover-mcp            List MCP servers for this project as JSON (with project/suggestion partition).
#   load-selection          Print current state file (with v1->v2->v3 migration).
#   prune                   Drop dead entries from selected/known; write state.
#   diff                    Compare current discovery to mounted baseline.
#   select-interactive      TUI selector (arrow keys + space) for skills, plugins, and MCP.
#   mounts                  Emit tab-separated host_path<TAB>skill_name for launcher.
#   record-mount            Set mounted_at_create + mounted_plugins_at_create; write state.
#   manifest                Emit JSON manifest of mounted skills + plugins for container.
#   materialize-plugins              Emit a container-shaped installed_plugins.json (paths rewritten).
#   materialize-credentials          Emit sandbox-isolated .credentials.json.
#   materialize-known-marketplaces   Emit container-shaped known_marketplaces.json (paths rewritten).
#   clone-to-project        Promote a Suggestion to Project (plugin or MCP); idempotent.
#   help                    Show usage.

#
# installPath is NOT reliably that directory. Claude Code records a cache path
# (plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>) for every install, but for a
# `directory`-source marketplace it never populates that cache -- it resolves the
# plugin from the marketplace's own source.path instead, leaving
# plugins/marketplaces/<name>/ an empty placeholder and the recorded cache path
# nonexistent. ccpraxis-local is exactly that case: every ccpraxis plugin's
# installPath points at plugins/cache/ccpraxis-local/<plugin>/0.1.0, which does
# not exist on this host.
#
# So a census keyed on installPath alone reports zero skills for precisely the
# plugins whose skills we need to judge. Resolve in two steps: trust installPath

# Subcommand: host-only-masks
# =====================================================================
#
# Emits the container paths of every host-only skill belonging to a plugin --
# selected in the picker OR enabled in any settings layer (Decision 10) -- that
# reaches the container through a LIVE BIND rather than a copy.
#
# Two different mechanisms put a plugin's files into the container, and a
# host-only skill has to be removed from each differently:
#
#   * A cache-copied marketplace is COPIED into claude-home, so a host-only
#     skill can simply be left out of the copy. Nothing for this subcommand.
#   * A directory-source marketplace (ccpraxis-local) is bind-mounted LIVE and
#     read-only, so nothing can be "left out" -- the tree in the container IS the
#     host's tree. The skill dir is MASKED instead: the launcher binds an empty
#     directory over it, leaving a directory with no SKILL.md, and a directory
#     with no SKILL.md is not a skill. Measured against podman before being
#     written: a nested bind over a subtree of a read-only bind mounts fine and
#     leaves its siblings intact.
#
# Decision 10: masks are computed for every plugin key SELECTED in the picker
# OR ENABLED (truthy) in any settings layer the container can see -- project
# settings.json, project settings.local.json, the container's user settings,
# and the seed settings the launcher would copy in on a fresh create. This is
# a UNION across layers, deliberately not Claude Code's local-over-project
# precedence: an over-mask (enabled true in one layer, false in another) costs
# one inert bind, while an under-mask is the bug this closes. Resolution goes
# straight through plugin_directory_source + plugin_skill_census -- it never
# consults discover_plugins/installed_plugins.json, so a plugin whose skills
# are ALL host-only (which discover_plugins would drop) is still masked whole,
# and no installed_plugins.json record is required at all.
# M3 (review m2): a settings.json saved by a Windows editor can carry a

# isn't a Linux directory in the container (e.g. ccpraxis-local).

#     keep the entry; rewrite `installLocation` to the container-side path
#     under /root/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/<name>. The launcher

#     KEEP the entry; rewrite BOTH source.path AND installLocation to the

# =====================================================================
#
# Generates the container's OWN sandboxed credentials file. The host's
# `claudeAiOauth` is NEVER read or injected — each sandbox owns an
# independent OAuth grant (its own in-container `/login`), so host and
# sandbox no longer rotate one shared grant into reuse-detection re-logins.
#
# - `claudeAiOauth` is PRESERVED from the container's OWN accumulator, gated
#   by a one-time reset marker (`.launcher/oauth-independent-migrated`): the
#   first post-change launch drops any stale host-copied token (the container
#   then prompts `/login`); thereafter the sandbox's own grant persists. The
#   host token is never a source.
# - PRESERVES the container's own `mcpOAuth` entries from previous runs,
#   so plugin auth done inside the sandbox persists across rebuilds.
# - DOES NOT propagate any host `mcpOAuth` entries. Every MCP server in
#   the container starts fresh; the user authenticates again inside the
#   sandbox (separate trust domain from the host).
# - Strips any other unknown top-level keys defensively.
# - Both copied values must be of HASH type. A malformed value (null,
#   string, array, scalar) is silently dropped — guards against a
#   corrupted-but-parseable JSON propagating undefined behavior into
#   Claude Code's parser, and matches the documented "missing -> fresh
#   auth" failure mode rather than producing confusing runtime errors.
# - Output is chmod'd 0600 before rename so the OAuth token is not left
#   world-readable on Linux/WSL2 hosts where the file is bind-mounted
#   into the container. (On Windows, Perl's chmod only twiddles the
#   read-only bit; the call is harmless and keeps one code path for all
#   platforms.)
