package KeepAwake;
# B5 — keep-awake held by the dashboard, gated by the orchestrator's busy-lease
# (Decisions #16/#21). While the dashboard is open the PC stays awake ONLY when
# there is active work or a pending auto-resume; it is allowed to sleep when idle
# OR when the only outstanding work is parked-waiting-for-a-human.
#
# The "active vs parked" judgement lives in the orchestrator (A3): it refreshes
# the busy-lease (`/tmp/.butler-busy`) every ~60s while work is active or an
# auto-resume is pending, and STOPS touching it when idle or only-parked. So the
# host-side dashboard does not re-derive that state — **busy-lease freshness is
# the keep-awake signal**. This module is the pure decision + a small lifecycle
# holder; the actual Windows wake-lock is asserted by `keep-awake.ps1`
# (SetThreadExecutionState via PowerShell, since Win32::API is absent in the host
# perl), started/stopped through injected seams so the lifecycle is testable.
#
# Split (mirrors Dashboard.pm / BackpackReview.pm): pure logic + seam-injected
# lifecycle here (unit-tested); the real spawn/kill of the PS helper + the lease
# read live in the launcher; whether the machine ACTUALLY stays awake is verified
# on a real desktop (attended).

# should_stay_awake($lease_age_secs, $stale_secs) -> 1|0
#   $lease_age_secs = seconds since the busy-lease's mtime, or undef if the lease
#                     is absent / unreadable. $stale_secs = the freshness window
#                     (match the orchestrator's BUSY_STALE_SECS).
#   Awake iff the lease exists AND is fresh. Absent lease (undef) -> sleep.
#   A NEGATIVE age means the lease mtime is in the "future" — i.e. host/container
#   clock skew on a lease the orchestrator just wrote, which only happens while a
#   run is actively touching it. Treat that as fresh and STAY AWAKE: a wrong
#   "sleep" here lets the host drop into standby and kills the live run (observed),
#   whereas a wrong "stay awake" only wastes some idle power. (The launcher now
#   computes the age entirely in container time, so a negative age should be rare;
#   this is the belt-and-suspenders guard.)

# classify_lease_stat_failure($output, $expected_path) -> $verdict | undef
#
# THE THIRD THING A `stat` FAILURE CAN MEAN. The busy-lease probe runs
# `stat -c %Y <lease>` inside the container and, until 2026-09-16, read ANY
# "No such file or directory" as 'lease-absent' -- a fact about the CONTAINER,
# which on_probe releases the wake-lock for immediately and without tolerance.
#
# On Windows that was wrong often enough to cost a night's fleet run. MSYS2
# rewrites argv elements that look like POSIX paths on their way into a native
# binary, so podman was handed the HOST's Windows temp directory and stat
# truthfully reported that no such file existed -- there. The container's lease
# was being refreshed every few seconds the whole time.
#
# Every stat implementation in play (GNU coreutils, busybox) quotes the
# offending path back in its message, so a quoted path that is NOT the one we
# asked for is positive evidence that the argument was rewritten in flight.
# That is a fact about US, and belongs in 'probe-failed' where on_probe holds
# through a tolerance rather than giving up.
#
# Returns:
#   undef            -- not a "no such file" failure; the caller's other
#                       classification paths still apply, unchanged.
#   'lease-absent'   -- a genuine absence: the message names our path, or names
#                       none at all.
#   'path-rewritten' -- the message names a DIFFERENT path.
#
# The no-path-named case deliberately falls back to 'lease-absent' rather than
# to the failure verdict: a stat variant that stays quiet must not be able to
# strand the wake-lock held forever after a run ends. Only positive evidence of
# rewriting diverges.

# new(start => \&start, stop => \&stop, on_event => \&on_event) — a lifecycle
# holder.
#   start->()        spawns the wake-lock helper, returns an opaque handle (PID).
#   stop->($handle)  releases it (kills the helper).
#   on_event->(%event) — s16-fleet-event-source: an optional emit seam, called
#     ONLY on a state TRANSITION (acquire/release), never on a repeated sync(1)
#     while already held nor a repeated sync(0) while already released -- that
#     would flood the activity panel with duplicates (the exact heartbeat-noise
#     problem s17 fixes elsewhere). Defaults to a no-op so existing callers that
#     don't pass it are unaffected. Never dies: a broken on_event coderef must
#     not take down the keep-awake lifecycle it's merely observing.
# All three default to no-ops so a holder is always safe to construct/sync.

# releases the lock directly (bypassing sync()/on_event) -- the sustained-
# failure release is a safety valve, not an operator-visible transition; it
# only ever fires once (subsequent probe-failed calls see !running and stay a
# silent 'noop'). Any non-probe-failed result resets the streak to 0.
