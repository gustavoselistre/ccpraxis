# =============================================================================
# Theme.pm -- the single source of colour and glyph truth for every ccpraxis
# terminal surface (statusline, the sandbox dashboard, launcher). A call site
# never sees a hex literal or a raw SGR escape: it names a semantic ROLE
# (Theme::sgr / Theme::paint) or a GLYPH NAME (Theme::glyph / glyph_width)
# and gets back an escape string or UTF-8 bytes for the terminal's detected
# capability.
#
# This package changes NO rendering by itself (blueprint unified-tui-design-
# system, package 02-design-tokens). Nothing consumes it yet; adoption is
# packages 05 (render library) and 10 (statusline rebuild),
# which is also the package that writes the GENERATED block this module's
# generated_block()/generated_markers() describe (see "THE GENERATED BLOCK"
# below).
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE REFERENCE BACKGROUND -- an assumption, not a measurement
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# A terminal exposes no portable way to query its own background colour, and
# this design system paints FOREGROUNDS ONLY -- it never repaints the
# background, because in a terminal (unlike a GUI toolkit) there is no alpha
# channel and the background belongs to the user's own theme, not to us.
#
# So every contrast guarantee in this module is measured against a STATED,
# DOCUMENTED reference background: #1E1E1E (30, 30, 30) -- see
# reference_background() below. That value is not a guess: it is chosen to
# be the LIGHTEST background this design system claims to support (VS Code
# Dark+'s "soft black"; Windows Terminal's default #0C0C0C and pure #000000
# are both darker). Because contrast against a fixed foreground is
# monotonically DEcreasing as the background gets lighter, every ratio this
# module asserts against #1E1E1E is a lower bound on the ratio the SAME
# foreground would achieve against any darker background, pure black
# included. Passing here implies passing there.
#
# What happens if the user's actual terminal background is lighter than
# #1E1E1E -- i.e. a light-theme terminal? The contrast guarantee simply does
# not hold for that user: this foreground ramp was designed for dark mode,
# and on a light background the text will look washed out. That is a
# LEGIBILITY DEGRADATION, never a crash -- Theme neither detects nor adapts
# to the real background, and no code path in this module depends on the
# assumption being correct. (Spec §2.4.5, escalation E-6.)
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# NO EMOJI -- WITH ONE NARROW, DELIBERATE EXCEPTION (title.*)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every glyph declared below is checked against a block-based emoji detector
# (mirrored, deliberately, in the test oracle) and none of them fall in an
# emoji range -- EXCEPT the title.* set, waived by operator decision on
# 2026-08-28.
#
# THE EXCEPTION IS SCOPED BY THE RULE'S OWN REASONING. This rule exists because
# emoji render inconsistently IN A TERMINAL: often double-width, often in
# colour, and at the mercy of the font stack. The title.* glyphs are the only
# ones that never reach a terminal -- they are the lead character of the OS
# WINDOW TITLE, drawn in the desktop's UI font, where these symbols are the
# recognisable ones and where the failure mode above does not arise.
#
# It is not a free pass -- a title.* glyph must still measure exactly one cell.
#
# TEXT PRESENTATION IS APPLIED BY THE TITLE BUILDER, NOT HERE, and the reason is
# worth recording because the obvious placement is wrong. These codepoints have
# emoji forms, so a U+FE0E variation selector is wanted to force the text form.
# Declaring it in this table looked right and broke the HEADER: glyphs from here
# pass through the render path's sanitiser, which strips zero-width and
# combining characters by design -- an invariant that exists to stop control
# sequences riding in on untrusted text -- so every affected glyph rendered as
# "?". The window title has no such sanitiser and is the only surface where the
# emoji form could appear, so the selector is appended there.
#
# Any glyph outside title.* is still held to the original rule. Richer non-ASCII glyphs (box-drawing, geometric shapes,
# braille) are used freely -- only emoji are excluded. Surfaces that still
# carry emoji today (scripts/statusline.pl, the sandbox dashboard module,
# bp-statusline.pl) are a recorded, tracked debt for the packages that own
# those files; this
# module's own glyph table is clean on arrival.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# DEGRADATION -- what "still renders legibly" means without colour
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# At the 'none' capability rung (no truecolor, no 256-colour, not even
# advertised) every semantic distinction this module's palette carries in
# COLOUR is also carried by a non-colour channel:
#   * the four state.* roles are distinguishable by GLYPH alone (four
#     pairwise-distinct status.* characters);
#   * the primary/secondary text distinction is carried by the SGR ATTRIBUTE
#     (attr(text.primary) differs from attr(text.muted): normal vs dim).
# One thing is DECLARED as a degradation, not asserted as preserved: the
# three-step neutral ramp (primary / muted / faint) collapses to two visible
# steps at 'none', because SGR has no third neutral attribute between normal
# and dim. attr(text.muted) and attr(text.faint) may therefore be equal.
# This is deliberate, not a defect (spec §2.3).
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# MODULE SHAPE (spec §2.0)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#   * Core modules only -- no CPAN.
#   * No "use utf8" -- every glyph below is declared with a "\x{...}" escape,
#     which yields a decoded character in a non-utf8 source file. This is
#     the same convention the sandbox dashboard module's own glyph table uses.
#   * No top-level side effects: loading this file performs no I/O, opens no
#     file, spawns nothing, reads no environment variable, and emits nothing
#     to the terminal. The capability lookup below is the ONLY place the
#     process environment is consulted, and only on first call, never at
#     load. All token DATA tables (roles, glyphs) live inside memoized
#     builder functions rather than as top-level literals. NOTE (reviewer
#     S3, package 02-design-tokens): this shape is NOT forced by any
#     t/theme-tokens.t source scan -- B-A2 scans the whole file (not
#     scoped to top-level-only) for spawn/I/O constructs and use/require
#     targets, none of which a plain top-level hash literal would trip;
#     B-A3's top-level-only scan forbids just a reference to the process
#     environment hash, a console-output call, or a call into the ambient
#     capability lookup -- none of which a literal table trips either. A
#     prior version of this comment misattributed the shape to "the
#     oracle's B-A3 source scan" -- traced line-by-line, that claim does
#     not hold. The
#     real reason is simpler: keeping every table behind a builder means
#     nothing in this module is ever populated except by an explicit call,
#     which matches the "no top-level side effects" rule in spirit even for
#     data that would itself have been inert as a literal.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# paint() SANITISES CALLER TEXT -- do not remove this as "unnecessary"
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Theme::paint($role, $text) scrubs $text through _scrub() (below, near
# paint()'s definition) before emitting it, in BOTH the known-role and the
# unknown-role-passthrough arms. This mirrors, at the token layer, the
# INV-3 guarantee the sandbox dashboard module's _safe/_safe_char family
# already established for fit_spans/clip_pad, and
# redteam-01.md MAJOR-2, which is the finding that closed this exact class
# of bug ONE layer down. paint() is the primitive packages 05/09/10 adopt
# wholesale for untrusted-ish strings (container names, git branches,
# blueprint/session names, file paths, transcript-derived labels) -- a
# bare concatenation here would silently reopen MAJOR-2 in the new
# canonical primitive (redteam.md H1, package 02-design-tokens).
# The guarantee: paint() output never carries a control byte (C0, DEL, C1),
# a raw ESC, a CSI or OSC sequence, or a zero-width/combining character
# that $text did not... in fact it MUST NOT carry any of those from $text,
# full stop -- deleted, never transformed into something else.
# The boundary: this guarantee is paint()'s alone. sgr() legitimately
# returns escape sequences by definition (that is its job), and a caller
# who hand-composes sgr($role) . $text . reset() instead of calling
# paint() gets NONE of this protection -- _scrub() only runs inside
# paint().
#   * Theme::display_width() PREVIOUSLY existed here as a thin, lazy
#     delegation into the legacy sandbox dashboard's own width core. Package
#     06 (unified-tui-design-system) deleted it outright rather than
#     repointing it at tui::Layout: tui::Layout itself loads Theme at compile
#     time, so a repoint would only have traded one 2-cycle for another
#     (driver ruling E-F). display_width now lives at exactly one place,
#     tui::Layout::display_width -- callers here use that directly.

# "accent hues at a common perceptual lightness so they read as one

        # AND THE HONEST CONCLUSION: colour buys almost nothing here. The two
        # columns pull against each other, and t/64's floor -- correctly -- caps
        # how dark a track may go before it stops reading as a channel on a dark
        # terminal. 3.18:1 against the old shared 'rule' figure of 3.11:1 is
        # noise. "Very dark grey" is delivered as far as the floor allows and no
        # further; anyone tempted to push to 236 for more separation should read
        # the vs-bg column first.
        #
        # What actually separates fill from track is GLYPH WEIGHT -- heavy rule
        # against light rule -- which is why that pairing, not this colour, is
        # the fix for a gauge that read as one undifferentiated smear.
        #
        # This role therefore earns its place by DECOUPLING, not by its value: a
        # border and a track have different jobs, and sharing 'rule' meant a
        # gauge tweak repainted every frame line on the screen.
        #
        # attr is deliberately EMPTY rather than '2'. Dim is a terminal-defined
        # transform, so stacking it on an already-dark grey makes the rendered

        # 1.91:1, so a gauge below about 40% would have been invisible.
        # ColorBrewer YlOrRd is the right idea inverted, brightest at LOW values
        # and darkest at critical (#BD0026, 2.53:1) -- backwards for a meter on
        # a dark ground. IBM's colourblind-safe set clears the contrast but is
        # CATEGORICAL, and using a categorical palette sequentially implies an
        # ordering it does not encode.

# THE GLYPH TABLE (spec §2.5) -- every non-ASCII character this design
# system may use, each with a DECLARED (not computed) display width. Theme
# contains NO width logic of its own: it never inspects codepoint ranges,
# never consults combining-mark properties, never implements a wcwidth.
# Width MEASUREMENT lives at tui::Layout::display_width, which sources this
# very table (via glyphs() below) for its own width lookups (package 06,
# unified-tui-design-system) -- Theme declares identity and width; it never
# measures.
#
# Built lazily and memoized by _glyphs_data() below (see the MODULE SHAPE
# note near the top of this file). The first nineteen entries are the
# spec's required minimum set. The "spinner.N" entries exist ONLY so
# this table is a superset of the sandbox dashboard's own glyph table's
# non-emoji entries at the same declared widths (spec §2.5's completeness
# rule) -- the dashboard's own glyph table carries the braille spinner
# frames this table must also name. There are SPINNER_FRAMES of them; see
# the block comment beside them for why that number is what it is.
#
# NO EMOJI: every codepoint below was checked against the emoji-range test
# in t/theme-tokens.t's own detector (mirroring spec §2.6.1) and none
# match. The Miscellaneous Symbols and Dingbats blocks in particular are
# off-limits to this design system.

# _scrub($text) -- paint()'s sanitiser. See the "paint() SANITISES CALLER
# TEXT" header note above for the guarantee and its boundary; this is the
# implementation. Deliberately conservative: every dangerous byte sequence
# is DELETED, never transformed into something else, and clean text passes
# through byte-for-byte unchanged (paint(role,'x') still equals
# sgr(role).'x'.reset() -- the oracle's B-B8 identity holds because 'x' has
# nothing for this function to remove).
#
# Order matters: complete CSI and OSC sequences are stripped as WHOLE units
# first (steps 1-2), so a caller cannot end up with the escape gone but its
# parameter/URL payload left behind as literal visible text (which would
# both leak the payload and desynchronise Theme::display_width()'s column
# count from what paint() actually emits -- the H1 width invariant).
# Step 3 catches a bare/dangling ESC that did not form a full CSI/OSC.
# Step 4 removes the remaining C0 controls (NUL, bare CR, BEL, ...) and DEL.
# Steps 1-4 are ASCII-only (every byte they match is <0x80), so they behave
# identically whether $t is a raw byte string or an upgraded Perl character
# string -- UTF-8 represents an ASCII byte as itself in either
# representation, so there is nothing encoding-specific to get wrong here.
#
# C1 CONTROLS (U+0080-U+009F) ARE FULLY IN SCOPE -- NOT "harmless high
# characters". On any terminal honouring 8-bit controls, every codepoint in
# this range is a live single-BYTE control in its own right, not merely
# something that becomes dangerous once UTF-8 encoded: U+009B is the
# single-byte CSI introducer, byte-for-byte equivalent to the two-byte
# "ESC '['" step 1 already strips (so "before" . chr(0x9B) . "2Jafter" is
# still a screen-clear on such a terminal); U+009D/U+009C/U+0090/U+0085 are
# likewise OSC/ST/DCS/NEL. This is the C1 half of the exact leak
# the sandbox dashboard module's _safe/_safe_char family already closed one
# layer down (that module's own comment names it "the live-C1/control-byte
# leak", redteam-01.md MAJOR-2, INV-3) -- paint() reopening it here would be
# the same bug one layer up (redteam.md H1).
#
# THE THIRD DEFECT IN THIS AREA, and why the rest of this comment exists:
# round 1 stripped C1 only as its UTF-8-ENCODED two-byte form (0xC2 0x80-
# 0x9F); round 2 added a bare ordinal strip s/[\x80-\x9f]//g to also catch a
# RAW SINGLE C1 BYTE (chr(0x9B) with no "use utf8" in effect -- this module
# has none, see the MODULE SHAPE note near the top -- is stored as exactly
# one byte equal to its own ordinal). That ordinal strip is CORRECT for a
# genuine Perl CHARACTER string, where every character is one array slot and
# an ordinal in 0x80-0x9F can only ever be a real C1 codepoint. It is
# DESTRUCTIVE for a Perl BYTE string carrying UTF-8-ENCODED text, because a
# multi-byte character's CONTINUATION bytes legitimately occupy that same
# 0x80-0x9F ordinal range: e.g. U+2026 encodes as E2 80 A6, and E2 80
# (which is 0x80, matched and deleted by the blind ordinal strip) leaves
# only A6 behind -- a corrupted, undecodable remnant. A byte whose ordinal
# is 0x80-0x9F is therefore AMBIGUOUS on its own: it means "C1 control" in
# a character string and "possibly just a continuation byte" in a byte
# string, and the two are indistinguishable by ordinal value alone -- only
# by knowing which representation the whole string is in. Blindly reusing
# one policy for both, as round 2 did, is the bug.
#
# So: normalise to CHARACTER representation before applying the C1/zero-
# width ordinal policy (steps 5-6 below), then return the result in the
# SAME representation the caller handed us, via three cases:
#   - Already a Perl character string (utf8::is_utf8 true): apply the
#     character-level policy directly (_scrub_chars) -- no conversion
#     needed. This is the case the round-2 character-mode C1 sweep proves
#     and remains untouched.
#   - A raw byte string that IS valid UTF-8: this is the sandbox dashboard
#     module's calling convention (Encode::encode('UTF-8', $out) on its own
#     span text) -- package 06 wiring that module to Theme is exactly where
#     this fires). Decode it, apply the SAME character-level policy, then
#     re-encode -- this is the fix.
#   - A raw byte string that is NOT valid UTF-8 (not decodable text at all
#     -- e.g. a lone C1 byte with no multi-byte context, which is what the
#     byte-mode C1 sweep corpus exercises): fall back to the byte-ordinal
#     strip (_scrub_bytes, round 1/2's approach). This remains correct
#     precisely because a byte that cannot be part of valid UTF-8 is, by
#     definition, not a legitimate multi-byte character's continuation
#     byte, so deleting it by raw ordinal cannot corrupt one.
#
# paint() must never die on untrusted input (it renders arbitrary caller
# labels), so the UTF-8 validity probe below is a non-throwing eval, and
# invalid input simply takes the conservative byte-level branch rather than
# propagating an error.
