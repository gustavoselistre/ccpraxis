# re-rendered to end with a single-character ellipsis.
#
# Added for t03-activity-column (blueprint tui-operator-feedback). The operator
# asked for activity rows that "could wrap to up to three lines and then
# ellipsis"; no wrap-to-N-then-ellipsis helper existed anywhere.
#
# BUILT ON wrap_line, NEVER BESIDE IT. Every property that makes wrap_line
# correct -- the atomic-span carve-out, the leading-indent recovery, the
# degenerate-indent fallback, "exactly $w columns, never mid-glyph" -- is
# earned by a lot of careful code and two packages' worth of fixes. A second
# wrapper would have to re-earn all of it and would drift the first time either
# was touched. This adds exactly one thing: a cap, applied afterwards.
#
# THE ELLIPSIS REPLACES CONTENT, NEVER APPENDS PAST $w. Cells are contracted to
# be exactly $w display columns, and a caller composing a row from several
# cells depends on that absolutely -- one over-wide cell shifts everything to
# its right. So the last kept row is rebuilt from a prefix that leaves room for
# the ellipsis, through the same make_cell/fit_spans path as every other cell.

# treated the return value as a hash and read a `char` key off it; that is a

#
# CHARACTER-LEVEL wrapping with a HANGING INDENT. A deliberate second wrapper,
# not a mode bolted onto wrap_line, because it answers a different question.
#
# wrap_line breaks at word boundaries and indents continuations by a small fixed
# amount. That is right for prose (a banner, a message). It is wrong for the
# Recent activity column, where every row is `HH:MM  <glyph> body` and the
# operator asked for exactly two things, in their words: "It doesn't need to
# respect word boundaries, I would rather have it just always break in a dumb
# way at the character", and "the wrapped text needs to be aligned to the text
# above ... should be aligned to the text itself after the icon".
#
# Word wrapping in a ~30-column column also wastes a lot of it: an event body is
# one long token like `claude_json_relocation_skip`, so word logic either
# overflows or leaves half the row empty. Breaking anywhere fills the column.
#
# $hang is the continuation indent in DISPLAY COLUMNS, applied to every row
# after the first, so continuations line up under the body rather than under the
# timestamp. Line 0 is never indented -- its own prefix already puts it there.
#
# Total: never dies, always returns at least one cell, and degrades to a single
# empty cell for a non-positive width. Roles are carried per character, so a
# break mid-span keeps both halves coloured as they were.

#
# Added for t04-blueprints-table (blueprint tui-operator-feedback). The
# operator: "the blueprints section should be styled as a table because right
# now its hard to see with things randomly aligned." It was literally that --
# _one_run_summary_spans concatenated variable-width fields with no padding, so
# nothing below the first field lined up with anything.
#
# WRITTEN ONCE, HERE, AND NOT INLINED INTO THE PANEL. That is the package's
# criterion 2, and it exists because the predecessor initiative spent two
# fix-batches on exactly this class of duplication. A second panel wanting
# columns must not need a second implementation.
#
#   \@rows  -- each row is an arrayref of CELLS, one per column, in column
#              order. A cell is either a plain string, or a spans arrayref, or
#              a hash { spans => [...] } / { text => ..., role => ... }.
#              A row may be SHORT; missing trailing cells render as empty.
#   \%opts:
#     width   => total display columns available (required to do anything
#                other than natural sizing)
#     gap     => columns between adjacent columns (default 2)
#     align   => \@('left'|'right', ...) per column, default all left
#     min     => \@(N, ...) per column -- the width below which a column is
#                dropped rather than shrunk further. Default 1.
#     drop    => \@(N, ...) per column -- drop order. The HIGHEST number goes
#                first. A column with no entry is never dropped.
#
# NARROW BEHAVIOUR IS DECIDED, NOT INCIDENTAL (criterion 3), in this order:
#   1. Every column at its natural width (the widest cell in it). If that fits,
#      done -- and this is the common case.
#   2. Otherwise DROP whole columns, highest `drop` first, until the rest fit at
#      natural width. Dropping beats squeezing: three columns you can read are
#      worth more than six you cannot, and a dropped column is obvious while a
#      squeezed one silently lies about its content.
#   3. If no droppable column is left and it still does not fit, SHRINK the
#      widest remaining column one step at a time, never below its `min`.
#   4. If it STILL does not fit, the row is emitted anyway and the caller's own
#      fit_spans/make_cell clips it. This function never returns a row it
#      claims fits when it does not.
#
# Cells are truncated with the same ellipsis wrap_capped uses, so a shortened
# value is visibly shortened rather than quietly wrong.
