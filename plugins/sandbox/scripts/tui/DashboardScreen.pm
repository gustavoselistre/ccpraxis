# tui::DashboardScreen -- the dashboard's content vocabulary (blueprint
# unified-tui-design-system, package 06-dashboard-screen). See
# specs/06-dashboard-screen-spec.md S2.4 for the binding API contract.
#
# This module composes the ccpraxis sandbox dashboard through
# tui::Screen/Frame/Layout/Meter (package 05's shipped render library). It
# owns the PANEL CONTENT VOCABULARY -- which facts render, in what order,
# suppressed when absent -- while the legacy Dashboard.pm keeps the
# side-effecting loop, key dispatch and spawn/signal logic and becomes a
# thin delegator for composition and width (spec S1.2).
#
# THE ARROW POINTS ONE WAY. Dashboard.pm may (and does) consume this module;
# this module may NEVER name Dashboard -- doing so would invert the
# tui/ library's dependency direction, exactly the shape package 05's AC-P4
# already forbids for the four modules it shipped (spec S1.3, S2.0).
#
# Pure and total: no clock, no process environment, no filesystem, no
# process, no console, no die/croak/confess. Every "now"-like value is an
# argument. Same forbidden-construct table as package 05's spec S2.6.

# THREE SPACES, NOT ONE, AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES THIS SAFE TO DO EVERYWHERE AT
# ONCE (blueprint Decision 21). " : " is three display columns and so is "   ",
# so every width computation, fit_spans budget, truncation point and row-width
# assertion downstream is unchanged -- only the characters differ. Collapsing
# to a single space would have shifted every value two columns left and turned
# a cosmetic change into a layout change.
#
# WHAT THIS RULE DOES NOT TOUCH (Decision 20): values. A label gutter, a
# provider prefix and a warning sentence are text this repo AUTHORS, and they
# lose their colons. An event body, a blueprint name, a container name, a path,
# an error string from a subprocess are DATA passing through -- rewriting those
# would make the screen disagree with the thing it reports on. A blueprint
# genuinely named foo:bar renders as foo:bar. Clock times keep their colon by

# spend for" named a RUN as the missing thing, which stopped being true when
# spend gained a run-independent snapshot (blueprint Decision 11); and it was
# useless even before that, because the operator is essentially never in a
# fleet run. The four texts below each name something that could actually be
# acted on.

# NO COLON in any of them (Decision 2). The label gutter's own colon belongs to

# 2026-08-28: "no point in having the 'collecting - no figures yet'").
#
# It was a fourth line restating what the panel had already said three times:
# every provider row above it independently renders "not collected yet", so the
# footnote added a row and no fact. The three OTHER texts stay, and the
# asymmetry is the point -- FAILED and STALLED name a fault that appears
# NOWHERE else on the screen (a sampler that died, or one still running with
# nothing to show after its grace), and losing those would trade a redundant
# row for a silent one. "Still collecting" is the expected state; a dead
# sampler is not.
#
# Returning an empty list rather than an empty string is deliberate: a span
# with no text still occupies a row, which is the row this exists to reclaim.
# The caller must therefore test before pushing -- see providers_lines.

# THE FAMILY IS SHARED; THE GLYPH IS PER-SURFACE, and keeping those separate is
# the point.
#
# An earlier version returned a single glyph token for both callers, which
# quietly replaced the HEADER's long-standing status glyphs with the window
# title's set -- a change nobody asked for. What actually had to be unified was
# which STATES group together (and whether they spin); how each surface draws a
# group is a separate question with different constraints:
#
#   header  renders in the terminal font, next to the status WORD, alongside the
#           status.* glyphs used elsewhere on the screen
#   title   renders in the desktop UI font, alone, with no word to disambiguate
#
# NO FAMILY DRAWS THE SAME ON BOTH SURFACES, and 'unreachable' was the exception
# that proved why it should not (operator, 2026-08-28).
#
# The header used to map unreachable to 'title.gone' -- the warning sign -- on
# the grounds that the operator had asked for that mark in both places. What that
# actually did was put an emoji-block codepoint (U+26A0) into the terminal, which
# is precisely what the no-emoji rule forbids. It went unnoticed because t/64
# waives that rule by TOKEN NAME (title.*), justified by title glyphs never
# reaching a terminal -- a claim this mapping falsified. The header now uses
# 'status.gone', its own non-emoji mark, and t/64 asserts that no terminal
# surface references a title.* token again.
#
# RULED 2026-08-28: the two vocabularies stay separate, permanently. The
# question had been open on taste alone -- one glyph set is simpler to hold in
# your head. What settled it is that the single family the two surfaces drew
# alike is the one that leaked an emoji into the terminal, so the shared entry
# was not a simplification, it was the defect. Unifying them means either the
# terminal takes emoji-block codepoints or the window title gives up the marks
# that survive taskbar truncation; both surfaces lose. They answer different
# questions -- the header has a status WORD beside it and the status.* set
# around it, the title has one glyph in a UI font and nothing to disambiguate
# it -- and container_presentation already carries everything they must agree
# on, which is the family and whether it spins.
# container_glyph($surface, \%presentation) -> Theme glyph token, or undef when
# the surface draws nothing of its own (running: the spinner IS the glyph).
#
# The table lives INSIDE the sub, not at file scope. t/66's AC-P1 forbids a
# top-level print/warn/say, and it scans the source outside sub bodies -- a
# file-scoped table containing the token 'status.warn' matched that scan. The
# guard is right to be blunt about it (the same oracle already had to learn to
# strip comments for the same reason), and the table has no business being a
# top-level side-effect-free-module exception anyway. It is small and rebuilt
# per call; container_glyph runs once per surface per frame.

# at 2 -- exactly this tree's own level step -- so a wrapped row's
# continuation lands exactly on the NEXT level's own indent (own_indent + 2
# == child_indent), a hierarchy inversion: a continuation of a package row
# reads as its own coordinator, a continuation of a coordinator reads as its
# own worker. tui::Screen DOES let a panel override the continuation indent
# via `wrap_indent`, but AT THE TIME THIS WAS WRITTEN only on its
# character-break wrap path; the word-wrap path this panel actually uses
# hardcoded tui::Screen's constant and ignored the override. Both
# tui/Screen.pm and tui/Frame.pm were outside that package's write set, so
# the plumbing gap could not be closed there (verified: switching the whole
# Blueprints panel to the char-break path instead was tried and reverted --
# it breaks t/182 AC14's "every word survives a wrap" guarantee, because
# character breaking is not word-safe for the "cur"/"paused" free-text
# lines that share this panel).
#
# So tree rows are pre-wrapped HERE, before tui::Screen ever sees them (see
# _wrap_tree_row/_wrap_tree_rows below), with THIS smaller continuation
# indent: own indent + 1 (3, 5, 7 for levels 1-3) never collides with a real
# level's own indent (2, 4, 6). A row that already fits the panel's content
# width hits tui::Frame::wrap_line's own unmodified fast path -- byte-
# identical passthrough -- so a row that never wraps is unaffected.
#
# THAT PLUMBING GAP IS NOW CLOSED. tui::Screen's word-wrap path honours
# `wrap_indent` too (needed by the approval screen's label/value rows, whose
# values wrapped back to column 2 from a gutter at 16). So this panel COULD
# now declare wrap_indent instead of pre-wrapping its own rows. It is left
# as-is deliberately: the pre-wrap is correct, tested, and per-ROW, while
# wrap_indent is per-PANEL and this panel mixes tree rows with free-text
# "cur"/"paused" lines that want the ordinary indent. Adopting it would be a
# behaviour change across t/182 and t/187, which is its own piece of work and
# not a side effect of closing the gap.

# oracle site), so the composed frame and the direct-call result can never
# diverge. Not part of the spec's headline public-surface list, but a normal
# Perl cross-package call -- Dashboard consuming tui:: is this package's
# whole point (Obligation 2).
# ===========================================================================
# ===========================================================================
# THE RESOURCES PANEL IS A TABLE, AND THE GAUGE IS ITS FIRST COLUMN
# (operator, 2026-08-26: "everything in the resources cell is misaligned. I
# wish it was a neat table instead", then: "Full table but the bars become the
# first thing").
#
# Every gauge row now has the same four columns:
#
#   <label gutter> <bar> <percent> <figures> <trailing note>
#
# The bar leading is not only what was asked for, it is what makes the rest of
# the table possible. With the figures first, the bar started wherever that
# row's numbers happened to end -- and since "2.1 GB used" and "231.3 GB used"
# are different widths, every bar and every percent landed in a different
# column. Putting the fixed-width things first means the gauges form a clean
# column immediately after the label, and the variable-width figures trail off
# to the right where their raggedness costs nothing.
#
# It also fixes the two CPU rows, which had no place in the old geometry at
# all: ctr cpu printed a bare percentage and host cpu printed a percentage
# followed by a bar, so neither lined up with anything. They are now ordinary
# gauge rows with an empty figures column.
#
# Rows with no gauge at all (snapshot, machine, podman) are unchanged: their
# text starts at the label gutter, where the bar column begins.
# ===========================================================================

# _gauge_value_spans($ratio, $pct_text, $figures, \@trail) -> \@spans -- the
# value half of a gauge row, in column order. $figures may be undef (the CPU
# rows have no used/free/total to show).
# _gauge_role($ratio) -> the role the FILL and the percent carry.
#
# COLOUR ONLY WHERE IT MEANS SOMETHING (operator, 2026-08-26: "I want the colors
# and styling of the usage bars to less distracting. I like the color coding and
# all, but right now it's not good").
#
# Every gauge row used to paint its bar, its percent AND its figures in
# pressure_role -- so a perfectly healthy machine rendered as five rows of
# bright green, and the one row that had something to say looked exactly as
# loud as the four that did not. Colour that is always on carries no
# information; it is just brightness.
#
# So the alarm palette is reserved for the alarm. Below the warn threshold --
# the normal state, and the state the panel is in nearly all the time -- a gauge
# is neutral grey and recedes into the panel. At warn and crit it takes
# pressure_role and becomes the only coloured thing on the screen, which is
# exactly when that is worth being.
# ...AND THE NORMAL FILL IS ACCENT, NOT GREY (same operator request, the
# "different colors" half).
#
# The first pass at quieting these rows made the below-warn fill text.muted --
# correct in that it stopped shouting, wrong in that it left the gauge
# indistinguishable from the label beside it. A meter is a UI element; it should
# read as one. accent is the token this design system already spends on "this is
# a thing, not prose" (the project name in the header, the used-token count in
# the statusline), it is calm, and it is nowhere near the alarm palette.
#
# So the ramp is now accent -> state.warn -> state.crit: an identity at rest, an
# alarm only under pressure. The track stays 'rule' either way.
# _gauge_role($ratio) -> the Theme role the FILL is painted in.
#
# A FOUR-STEP RAMP over the Radix step-9 palette (Theme's gauge.* roles), which
# encodes magnitude continuously AND the two thresholds categorically:
#
#     < 50%              gauge.low    blue
#     50% .. warn        gauge.mid    teal
#     warn .. crit       gauge.warn   orange
#     >= crit            gauge.crit   red
#
# The two upper boundaries are tui::Meter's own PRESSURE_WARN/PRESSURE_CRIT,
# read through pressure_role rather than restated, so this cannot drift from the
# thresholds everything else uses. Only the extra split at half is local, and it
# is what turns a three-state indicator into a ramp.
#
# This replaced a scheme that painted everything below the warn threshold in
# 'accent': a disk at 5% and a disk at 70% looked identical, so the bar's colour
# carried no information until something was already wrong.

    # is no side column, and the panel falls back into the band flow -- where
    # flex is exactly what stops it being squeezed out by the panels above it.
    # Dropping the flag would have made the narrow case worse than it is today.
    # ACTIVITY_HANG is the width of an event row's fixed prefix, so a wrapped
    # row's continuation lines up under the BODY rather than under the

    # bad here: an event body is one long token (claude_json_relocation_skip),
