# Dashboard.pm — the raw-ANSI TUI dashboard framework for `claude-sandbox` (B2).
#
# Decision #19: `claude-sandbox` (the only user-typed form) always lands HERE —
# a live dashboard, not a scrolling log. The dashboard is the manager window: it
# holds the container alive via the heartbeat (over the injected podman-exec
# seam) and exposes two hotkeys (Decision #18):
#   [c] launch-claude   — spawn a NEW terminal window running `claude-sandbox
#                         --session <project>` (the existing connector + session
#                         picker), with a wt.exe -> `start` -> in-window fallback
#                         ladder (Decision #19).
#   [s] shutdown-all    — write the fleet-wide graceful-shutdown signal
#                         (`runs/.shutdown` in every blueprint, consumed by the
#                         A4 gate).
#
# This module is split into a PURE core (layout / frame composition / render
# diff / key dispatch / spawn-argv / signal-path derivation — all unit-tested in
# tests/t/dashboard-framework.t with no terminal) and a thin seam-injected loop
# (`run`). Every side effect the loop performs — heartbeat touch, container
# inspect, state gather, key read, terminal size, spawn, signal write, raw-mode
# enter/leave, output — is an injected coderef, so the loop itself is driven by
# the test harness with a fake clock and a scripted key queue.
#
# RENDER MODEL (the B0 carry-forward / flicker fix, extended by s04, then by
# the span-diff change): never `\e[2J` per frame. Clear once on a full redraw
# (first frame or a resize), then update only the rows whose SIGNATURE
# changed (`_cell_sig`). A changed row is no longer always re-emitted whole:
# `_row_diff_ansi` diffs the row's spans against the previous frame's (common
# prefix / common suffix by role+text) and, when the changed middle is the
# same DISPLAY WIDTH on both sides (so nothing after it would shift), emits
# ONLY that middle at its column -- no `\e[K`. This is what stops the
# top-row spinner from visibly blanking-then-refilling every tick. Anything
# that changes the middle's width falls back to the old whole-tail repaint
# (`\e[<row>;<col>H` + text-to-end-of-row + `\e[K`). The whole burst is
# wrapped in synchronized-output `\e[?2026h` … `\e[?2026l`.
#
# Composed rows are a STYLED-SPAN model (s04): a row is an ordered list of
# `{ text, role }` spans; a composed cell carries both the spans and their plain
# concatenation (`$cell->{text}`), fit to EXACTLY `display_width($cell->{text})
# == $cols` terminal display COLUMNS (measured by `display_width`, NOT byte
# `length` — a status dot / spinner / gauge glyph is 1-2 display columns but
# several UTF-8 bytes). Encoding rule: a string is treated as already-decoded
# characters iff it contains a codepoint > 0xFF; otherwise it is decoded
# leniently as UTF-8 (malformed bytes -> U+FFFD, never dies/warns). Every string
# the module returns is UTF-8 bytes (no `use utf8`, no `binmode`). Color is
# applied at render time per span by role (`sgr_for_role`). Rich panels /
# box-drawing are B3/B4's job.
#
# CALLER CONTRACT (D3): callers MUST pass UTF-8 BYTES, not already-decoded
# (wide-char) Perl strings. "Already decoded iff some codepoint > 0xFF" is a
# KNOWN, ACCEPTED source of imprecision for a genuinely-decoded string whose
# codepoints are all <= 0xFF: the 2-CHARACTER decoded string "\x{00C2}\x{00A9}"
# is re-read as the 2 BYTES 0xC2 0xA9, which happen to be valid UTF-8 for
# U+00A9 -- so display_width reports 1 instead of 2. This is cosmetic only
# (the row is still padded to exactly $cols; INV-1 holds, per an exhaustive
# sweep) and is deliberately NOT "fixed" by a smarter heuristic -- pass bytes
# in and the ambiguity never arises (s04 fix-batch, F8: see reviewer-01.md).
#
# Non-TTY / no-Term::ReadKey fallback is decided by `decide_mode`; launcher.pl
# keeps its proven plain heartbeat loop for that case (graceful degradation,
# Decision #19 / B0).

# one byte skipped. This version advances by matching the longest run of valid
# UTF-8 in ONE regex pass (one Encode::decode call per GOOD run, not per bad
# byte) and only steps a single byte at a time across genuinely malformed
# bytes -- linear in the input regardless of how bad bytes are distributed.

    # THE LEAD CHARACTER ANIMATES ONLY WHERE ANIMATION MEANS SOMETHING.
    #
    # The operator asked for "proper animation on the first character, just
    # like the running spinner". Taken literally that would animate in every
    # state -- and the lead character is not decoration: it is the ONLY status
    # signal that survives into a taskbar button or an alt-tab list, where the
    # rest of the title is truncated away. Spinning it unconditionally would
    # trade the one place you can see "this exited an hour ago" for motion.
    #
    # So: running animates (motion is exactly what "running" means), and every
    # NOT-RUNNING state keeps its literal, glanceable character. The states that
    # need you to look are the states that stop moving, which is a stronger
    # signal than either half alone.
    #
    # `!` IS THE EXCEPTION, AND IT IS A REAL ONE (operator, 2026-08-26: "the
    # title of the terminal replaces the spinner with a `!` in some occasions,
    # when is that? when there's something that needs me? I wish the `!` would
    # appear after the spinner instead of replacing it").
    #
    # They are right, and the distinction is that `!` is not a state of the
    # CONTAINER. `x`, `-` and `?` all mean the container is not running -- there
    # is nothing to animate, so the literal character replacing the spinner
    # loses nothing. But needs-you fires while the container is running
    # perfectly well; suppressing the spinner there threw away the "still alive"
    # signal to say "and also, look at me". Both are true, so both are shown:
    # the spinner keeps spinning and the `!` follows it.
    #
    # It follows rather than leads deliberately -- the lead character is the one
    # guaranteed to survive taskbar truncation, and "is this thing alive" is the
    # question that has to be answerable from a single glyph.
    # GLYPHS CHOSEN BY THE OPERATOR, 2026-08-28. Each comes from Theme so the
    # table stays the single source and this file stays ASCII.

    # the one signal that survives taskbar truncation.

    # declared in the glyph table because the table feeds the HEADER too, and
    # the render path's sanitiser strips zero-width characters by design -- so a
    # selector baked into the glyph turned every header glyph into "?".

# _fixed_region_height(\%state, $cols) -> $h (PRIVATE, pure). The single
# arithmetic mirror of the fixed (non-Activity) region's height, shared by
# activity_capacity so it agrees with what compose_frame actually renders.
#
# REBUILT (package 06, spec S2.4.9): derives panel heights from
# tui::DashboardScreen::panels() and simulates the SAME tui::Layout::place
# band-row assignment compose() makes, summing the height of every band-row
# STRICTLY BEFORE the one containing 'Recent activity' -- rather than a
# fixed "first two panels join" assumption, because tui::Layout::place's
# band width (package 05) GROWS with $cols above the breakpoint (more than
# two panels can share a row on a wide terminal), so Activity itself can
# join the same band-row as an earlier panel rather than always starting a
# fresh one. Simulating the actual placement is what keeps this in exact
# agreement with compose_frame regardless of how many panels are present.
#
# REBUILT AGAIN (package t02-wrap-on-overflow): a panel body row is no
# longer always exactly one rendered row -- tui::Screen::_render_panel now
# runs every logical line through tui::Frame::wrap_line, which emits MORE
# THAN ONE cell for a row that overflows its band's own width $w (S2.4 of
# specs/t02-wrap-on-overflow-spec.md). "1 + scalar(@$lines) + 1" (title +
# one-row-per-line + trailing blank) silently assumed a row can never grow
# taller than its own logical-line count, which stopped being true the
# moment wrapping shipped. This simulates the EXACT SAME wrap_line call
# _render_panel makes (same synthesized 2-space-indent line shape, same
# role selection, same WRAP_CONTINUATION_INDENT) using each band-row cell's
# OWN placed width ($cell->{w}, from tui::Layout::place) rather than $cols,
# because a panel sharing a band-row with another is narrower than the full
# terminal width -- the same width difference that made the 'backpack :
# ... manage' Run-panel row wrap only at cols=40, not at cols=120.
#
# REBUILT A THIRD TIME (fix-batch step 7, red-team Finding 2): the two
# rebuilds above still summed every pre-Activity band's NATURAL (unclamped)
# height, never modelling two things the real renderer (_place_and_render,
# tui/Screen.pm) does: (a) `tui::Screen::flex_reserve($body_height)` is held
# back from every PRE-flex band, and (b) a pre-flex band that would not fit
# in what is left is SKIPPED outright, not counted at its natural height.
# Both require knowing $body_height, which this function did not previously
# take. $rows is now an OPTIONAL third parameter -- callers that supply it
# (activity_capacity, below) get the capped/reserve-aware total that agrees
# with compose_frame at realistic terminal sizes (verified:
# t/wrap-width-regressions.t, rows=30 cols=90/120). Callers that omit it
# (t/dashboard-framework.t, t/layout-responsive.t, t/panel-semantics.t's direct 2-arg AC16 calls -- pre-existing, untouched
# tests) fall back to the OLD natural/uncapped total, exactly as before this
# fix-batch: not because the cap doesn't apply to them, but because without
# $rows there is no $body_height to cap against, and guessing one would risk
# a WORSE (silently wrong) prediction for those call sites rather than a
# knowingly-approximate one. This is the one part of Finding 2 this

#
# SELECTION (MAJOR-1). `podman machine start` takes no name and acts on the
# DEFAULT machine, so the reading must describe the default machine, never "any
# machine that happens to be running". The rule is `parse_machine_list`'s in
# Resources.pm (:97-114) verbatim: the element with a truthy `Default` wins
# regardless of position, else the first HASH element. A host with a second,
# hand-made machine running while ours is down must read 'stopped' -- reading
# 'running' there routes the user into a rebuild that `rm -f`s a healthy
# container.
#
# FIELD READ (MAJOR-2/MAJOR-3). `Starting` is read FIRST and is its own answer:
# a machine mid-auto-start after a host resume is neither running nor stopped,
# and calling it 'stopped' makes [l] fire a `podman machine start` that exits 125.
# `Running` is next, boolean-ish only. The `State` / `Status` spellings other
# podman versions emit are the fallback. If NONE of the four is present the
# answer is 'unknown' -- never a confident 'stopped', which would paint a
# permanent red "podman machine is stopped" banner over a healthy sandbox.
