# launcher.pl — unified `claude-sandbox` launcher (plugins/sandbox/scripts/).
#
# Replaces the duplicated logic that used to live in the launcher
# .sh and .ps1 files. Both are now thin shims that locate perl and
# exec this script.
#
# Responsibilities (mirrored from the original .sh/.ps1 line-for-line):
#   - Arg parsing (positional project-path, --resume-session UUID).
#   - Bootstrap path: if the sandbox home doesn't exist, ask the user whether
#     to set up a sandbox here; on confirm, invoke bootstrap.pl
#     (deterministic perl-driven setup — no agent in the loop); re-check
#     after; abort if still not set up.
#   - Per-project mkdir-based lock + dead-PID cleanup + signal trap.
#   - Image presence + Containerfile/launcher hash drift, with rebuild prompt.
#   - Pin discovery snapshots (skills + plugins + MCP) for the whole run.
#   - Run the TUI (perl select-interactive).
#   - Compute staleness reasons (version, age, hashes, drift) + interactive
#     [r]/[c] rebuild prompt.
#   - Materialize plugin registry + sandbox credentials.
#   - Build skill/plugin/extra-env/extra-mount lists.
#   - Writable claude.json seeding.
#   - Launch or reattach (podman exec/start/create) with the full mount
#     set; exec replaces this perl process at the end.

# Disable MSYS2 argument-path conversion before spawning any subprocess.
# MSYS2 (Git for Windows) treats every argv element that looks like a POSIX
# path and TRANSLATES it to a Windows path before invoking native binaries.
# For podman `-v HOST:CONTAINER[:opts]` args, MSYS2 sees the colons, treats
# the whole thing as a `:`-separated PATH-like list, converts each side
# separately, and re-joins with `;`. Result: podman receives
# `C:\host\path;C:\fake\container\path` (note the `;C`), tries to mount the
# `;C`-suffixed host path, can't find it, and silently creates a directory
# at that mangled name on the host — leaving onboarding-bypass / CLAUDE.md /
# settings.json mounts pointing at empty dirs. Setting MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL=*
# disables the translation entirely for this perl process and its children.
#
# BUT — podman.exe (Podman on Windows) does NOT auto-translate `/c/foo` style
# POSIX paths. With MSYS2 disabled, we must hand it Windows-style paths or
# it errors with "no such file or directory" on the build context / mount
# source. So we ALSO convert every host path that goes into a podman arg to
# `C:/foo` form upfront (see `winify_path` below). The two together give us

# Item 4 (D5) -- RULING REVERSED 2026-08-03 after reading q04's recorded
# reasoning. q05's ledger framed this as "a documented contract the code does
# not honour": the help text promises the extra list at
# ${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/ccpraxis-protected-paths.json while the code
# pins it to the authoritative home. The first fix here honoured
# CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR. That was WRONG, and t/53 caught it (AC-57, AC-58).
#
# ProtectedPaths.pm records the opposite decision, with measurements: a
# directory named VERBATIM by a single environment variable is NOT a trusted
# source, so CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR and USERPROFILE were deliberately dropped from
# the source set, because trusting them "re-opened the hole q03 closed by
# pinning extra_list_path" and additionally caused a C6 regression that
# refused a legitimate ccpraxis clone for an ordinary user with no attacker
# involved.
#
# The reasoning that made honouring it look safe was that the extra list is
# add-only, so it can only ever ADD refusals. That is true of the list's
# CONTENTS and false of its LOCATION: redirecting WHERE the list is read from
# means the user's real list is never read at all -- fewer protected roots,
# fewer refusals, failing OPEN. That is exactly the "silently void the user
# list" failure q03's Decision #5 pinned this path to prevent.
#
# So the code is right and the PROMISE is what was wrong. The help text and
# docs/protected-paths.md are corrected instead; the path stays pinned to the
# authoritative home, which item 3 above now derives through the seam.
#
# Kept as a LITERAL in the call block below rather than hoisted into a
# variable: t/53's AC-57 and AC-58 read the call block's own text to prove
# both keys are pinned to the same authoritative-home prefix, and a variable
# defeats that check even when the value is identical. The pin is meant to be
# visible at the call site.

# the module's default sink is an in-memory closure, and the two things that
# feed it are `podman build` (unbounded) and the arbitrary install commands a
# backpack declares (also unbounded). Measured with the in-memory default,
# 5,000 lines of 1 KiB retained 5,125,000 bytes for the life of the launch and
# never freed a byte of it. A File::Temp file costs nothing to hold and is
# byte-exact, which is the contract capture_replay owes failure_report.
#
# :raw is load-bearing on Windows: without it a "\n" written here comes back
# as "\r\n" and the replay is no longer the bytes that went in.
# UNLINK => 1 so the file dies with the process; nothing reads it afterwards.

# MSYS2 (Git-for-Windows perl) silently mangles any argv element that
# contains `:` — it treats the value as a POSIX PATH-list, splits on `:`,
# runs each side through POSIX→Windows conversion, and re-joins with `;`.
# So `-v HOST:CONTAINER` becomes `HOST_winpath;C:\?\CONTAINER_winpath` and
# podman bind-mounts a `;C`-suffixed phantom path. The env-var disable
# (MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL=*) only matches argv values literally starting with
# `*`, which is useless here.
#
# Fix: emit mount specs in podman's `--mount` syntax. Commas and `=`
# separate fields instead of `:`, and the value starts with `type=` which
# MSYS2 won't recognize as a path-like arg → no conversion attempt. All
# existing call sites continue to push `'-v', 'HOST:CONTAINER[:opts]'`
# into the args list (that's still the most readable form to author); we
# rewrite the whole list right before `system(@args)` via
# `convert_v_to_mount`. Belt-and-suspenders alongside the env-var guard
# and the runtime `;C` corruption detector.

# Ensure base image exists. Capture instead of redirect — `> /dev/null`
# under cmd.exe (native Win32 perl) wouldn't resolve; backticks with
# `2>&1` discard cleanly on all shells.
# Global cross-project build lock (Decision #9): prevents two launchers from
# simultaneously building the same image. Fail-open: if acquire times out (e.g.
# a crashed previous holder), proceed anyway — a missed lock must never
# permanently block a launch. After acquiring, RE-CHECK the image (the winner
# may have already built it); only build if still missing. release() frees this
# lock; release_all() in END/signals also covers it.
# PROBE ONLY. NOTHING IS BUILT BEFORE THE OPERATOR HAS ANSWERED.
#
# This used to build the base image here, which is BEFORE the skills picker and
# before the stale/rebuild prompt. Three things were wrong with that, all
# reported by the operator on 2026-09-07 ("some things were already being built
# before that step? and then things kept getting built?"):
#
#   1. Choosing Rebuild at the prompt force-builds the image again (:2972), so
#      a launch that started with no image could build it TWICE, with nothing
#      able to change in between.
#   2. The reattach path (`podman exec` into a running container, ~:2508)
#      returns without ever needing an image -- and it sits AFTER this point, so
#      rejoining a running sandbox could trigger a full image build it would
#      never use.
#   3. Being asked "rebuild or continue?" after minutes of building reads as
#      the launcher ignoring the answer it is about to ask for.
#
# The build cannot simply move earlier-and-conditional either: whether it is
# wanted depends on the prompt, and the prompt depends on the skills picker
# (one staleness reason compares the selection against what the container was
# built with, :2726). So the probe stays here, where the lock and the existence
# question already lived, and the single build happens after the answer.

# Reported 2026-09-07: "I got to the screen where I choose the plugins skills
# etc. Then after a while I got the r vs c to rebuild vs continue dialog. It
# didn't make sense to me because some things were already being built before
# that step? and then things kept getting built?" All three observations were
# right, and the second complaint is the sharper one: the prompt offered
# "Continue as-is" unconditionally, including when there was no image to
# continue from -- in which case continuing would reach `podman create` against
# a nonexistent image and fail.
#
# So the prompt is now built from what is actually on disk:
#
#   image missing   -> a build is going to happen no matter what is chosen, so
#                      "continue" cannot mean "skip it". Said plainly instead of
#                      offered as a choice.
#   container missing -> it will be created regardless; Rebuild differs only in
#                      also rebuilding the base image.
#   version mismatch -> not offered at all. Forced (see $FORCE_REBUILD_REASON).
#
# And the build itself moved here, AFTER the answer, so nothing is built before
# the operator has said what they want -- and so it happens exactly once. It
# used to be able to run twice in one launch: once because the image was
# missing, then again because Rebuild was chosen.

# >>> launch-emit:prepare:BEGIN
# EVERYTHING FROM HERE TO create IS ONE VISIBLE STAGE (bug report
# 20260829-194441-fd0a).
#
# This stretch had no stage marker at all, and _launch_stage_begin is the only
# thing that repaints in this phase — so the frame kept displaying whatever was
# last drawn while the launcher did ~1600 lines of real work: the skills.pl
# `mounts` child, the plugin store copy, credentials, a `wsl -d ... ip -4 addr`
# host-IP probe, session selection, and the whole claude-home layout. On a stale
# sandbox that meant choosing an option and then watching a dead menu for 20+
# seconds. Every one of those steps is legitimate; none of them announced itself.
#
# It is ONE stage rather than six because the operator's question is "is it
# alive", not "which file is it copying" — and one honest marker beats six that
# each need their own end-state handling on every early-exit path below.
_launch_stage_begin('prepare');

# The stale-container prompt. Three paths, in descending order of capability:
#
#   1. TUI      — a single-choice screen through tui::LaunchScreens, sharing
#                 the launch frame, the seams and the keep-alive with every
#                 other launch screen (package 12).
#   2. cbreak   — the pre-package-12 in-place menu, still used when a TTY is
#                 available but the launch never opened a frame (CCPRAXIS_NO_TUI,
#                 or a teardown that dropped us back to plain mid-launch).
#   3. line-read — no TTY or no Term::ReadKey at all, so CI keeps working.
#
# 'r' and 'c' keep working on paths 1 and 2 alike: path 1 declares them as
# model shortcuts and prints them on the rows, so the affordance the old menu
# advertised in its footer survives the conversion rather than being dropped.
# decide_forced_rebuild($container_exists, $recorded_version, $host_version)
#   -> reason string, or undef
#
# PURE, for the same reason decide_launch_plan is: this decides whether the
# operator gets a choice at all, and that is not something to leave only
# testable by launching.
#
# THREE CASES, and the third is the one that was missing.
#
#   No container            Nothing to be skewed against. A container will be
#                           created at the host version. No force.
#
#   Recorded != host        The mismatch the operator asked to be non-negotiable.
#                           claude-home is shared through the bind mount and its
#                           session files assume one version wrote them.
#
#   Container but NO record This is the gap. `claude-version` is written only
#                           inside the create block (:4754), so a container
#                           whose .launcher dir was cleared, moved, or written
#                           by an older launcher exists with no recorded
#                           version -- and the old `-f` guard simply skipped the
#                           check, letting an unknown-version container through
#                           to "continue". Absence of evidence is not evidence
#                           of a match: it forces, so the unsupported state
#                           cannot be reached by default. The rebuild writes the
#                           record, so this self-heals in one launch rather than
#                           forcing forever.

#
# WHY build_image IS `rebuild || !image` AND NOT `rebuild || (!image &&
# !container)`. It is tempting to skip the build when a container already
# exists, since that container runs from its own pinned layers and will not use
# a freshly built image. Two things make that wrong:
#
#   The launch gate aborts with diagnosis 'image missing' when a container is
#   EXITED and the image is absent (:4882), and a container between sessions is
#   normally exited. Skipping the build there turns a recoverable state into a
#   failed launch.
#
#   A container descending from a superseded image is not an inconsistency to
#   avoid; it is the routine state after ANY rebuild, and the launcher already
#   says so (:2903). So building does not create skew -- the skew is expected,
#   and the build is what keeps recreate/recover possible.

#      takes over and this pass never needs to run again for THIS project.
#   2. $LEGACY_SKILLS_CLEANUP_MARKER -- MACHINE-SCOPED (below): a flag file
#      under the HOST USER'S REAL ~/.claude (i.e. $CLAUDE_HOST_CONFIG, computed
#      from home_dir() at the top of this file -- NEVER $CLAUDE_DATA, which is
#      THIS PROJECT's claude-home and is what gets bind-mounted to /root/.claude
#      inside a container). Signal 1 ALONE was the original bug: on a machine
#      with many projects, every NEW project's first post-upgrade launch has no
#      manifest yet, so "one-time" re-fired forever, once per project, including
#      projects that did not exist yet at fix time. Signal 2 makes it fire AT
#      MOST ONCE ON THIS MACHINE, which is what the operator's "one-time
#      removal of these two, then warn-only" authorisation actually meant.
#
# CONTAINER VS HOST: launcher.pl is a HOST-side orchestrator -- it is the
# process that invokes podman to CREATE the container in the first place, and
# it never runs inside one (the code that runs inside the container lives
# under plugins/sandbox/container/, a disjoint execution context). So $HOME /

# persist. The canonical location is now claude-home/.credentials.json (a
# real file inside the RW dir bind, rename-safe). If the new file is absent
# (or a stale 0-byte placeholder, treated as absent below) but the legacy one
# exists, carry it over so accumulated in-container
# mcpOAuth tokens survive the move (materialize-credentials below re-reads
# its own output to preserve mcpOAuth). Copy (not move): the legacy file is
# left in .launcher/ as a harmless RO orphan. Best-effort — a failure here
# just means the container re-auths its MCP servers (re-login of MCP plugins,
# no token loss). NOTE: materialize-credentials NO LONGER copies claudeAiOauth
# from the host (blueprint 01-independent-grant, Decision #1). It preserves the
# CONTAINER's own claudeAiOauth when the reset marker
# .launcher/oauth-independent-migrated is present, and performs a one-time
# reset (clears the stale host-copied token, then creates the marker) when it
# is absent — so a migrated/fresh sandbox with no own grant prompts /login.
# claude-home is RW from the container: a planted (dangling) symlink at the

# Host data layout (claude-home) + blueprint application
# =====================================================================
#
# /root/.claude inside the container is a direct bind mount of the host's
# <project>/.ccpraxis-local-data/claude-home/ ($CLAUDE_DATA). Session jsonl,
# tasks/, lockfiles, settings.json, CLAUDE.md, .credentials.json, .launcher/ —
# all are live host files. No podman cp round-trips, no seed-on-create, no
# rescue. The host filesystem IS the state.
#
# On container create we ensure the launcher's canonical copies of CLAUDE.md
# / settings.json / .credentials.json live at claude-home/ on the host so
# they appear at /root/.claude/{CLAUDE.md,settings.json,.credentials.json}
# inside the container. Same for the global claude config: it now lives at
# /root/.claude/.claude.json — an ordinary file INSIDE the /root/.claude dir
# bind, reached via CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/root/.claude (an -e literal on
# `podman create`). No single-file bind exists at /root/.claude.json.
#
# Historical: from the first sandbox version through 2026-06, /root/.claude
# was backed by a podman xfs volume to dodge two Hyper-V 9p bugs (O_APPEND
# EIO + utimensat silent-fail). The WSL2 backend's /mnt/c bind honors both
# correctly, so the volume + sync-sidecar architecture was retired.
# Reintroduce ONLY if a future backend's host-bind fails the t/01
# (O_APPEND, utimensat UTIME_NOW, utimensat explicit-timestamp) probes.

# Single-file bind mounts require the host path to exist before podman

# Seed or self-heal claude-home/.claude.json so the in-container claude never
# lands in the onboarding wizard. Idempotent: writes ONLY when the on-disk file
# is missing / 0-byte / unparseable (reseed the template) or is valid JSON but
# missing an onboarding-bypass key (merge it in, preserving every other key).
# A valid, already-onboarded config is left untouched (heal_claude_json returns
# undef). The write is a temp-file + rename() under an mtime-stale-safe mkdir
# lock (spec 02-implement-config-safety-spec.md B19-B27) BECAUSE .claude.json
# is an ordinary file inside the /root/.claude dir bind (CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=
# /root/.claude), where in-container writers (the CLI itself, an mcp
# add/remove, a token refresh) use the SAME atomic protocol and the SAME lock
# path — so the two writers interoperate instead of tearing each other's
# write. This can only land after enforce_container_config_shape (B12-B18,
# above) forces every already-created container off the old single-file-bind
# shape: renaming the host file while an old-shape container is still
# attached would leave that container following a ghost inode and lose its
# config silently (s01 sec 4 sequencing hazard).
#
# Called at three points so every entry path self-heals: at top-level manager
# setup (above), just before `podman create` (the pre-create host file must
# exist AND be valid so claude doesn't see a 0-byte file), and at the top of
# enter_dashboard (which every manager path — fresh create, start-of-stopped,
# and bare-attach to an already-running container — funnels through). The
# dashboard process is the single per-project manager and no connector claude
# is running yet at that point, so it is the safest moment to write the
# shared file.

# Row 5 (B21-B24). mkdir-based, mtime-stale-safe lock, local to launcher.pl
# (NOT SandboxLock.pm — that module's kill(0,$pid) staleness is meaningless
# here: the launcher runs on the HOST while the competing writer runs IN the
# container, across the PID-namespace split). %o: timeout (wall seconds,
# default 5), poll (default 0.1), stale (seconds, default 30). A lock older
# than `stale` is taken over — rmdir if it's a directory, unlink if it's a
# regular file (the CLI's lock artefact kind is not guaranteed) — then
# re-mkdir'd once; losing that race counts as "still held" (B22). Measured
# constraint: mtime granularity on this bind is WHOLE SECONDS

# Detect orphaned in-container claude processes — survivors of a prior

# through conmon to the in-container claude, so claude stays alive but
# decoupled from any user terminal. The orphan keeps refreshing its
# lockfiles in /root/.claude/, which then BLOCKS any new claude session
# that tries to acquire the same locks.

#
# container/heartbeat.sh reaps its own container when the host manager stops
# touching /tmp/.launcher-alive. That is usually right, and it used to be

# 2026-08-08 an operator left a fleet running, Windows entered connected
# standby for five hours forty minutes, and the container reaped itself two
# seconds after the resume -- with a clean exit code, because from the loop's
# point of view it had shut down correctly. There was nothing to read.
#
# heartbeat.sh now writes a record to .launcher/last-reap.txt (on the bind
# mount, so it outlives the container) BEFORE breaking. This is the host end:
# the next launch reads that record and says, in words, why the operator came
# back to a stopped container.
#
# Shown ONCE per record. The marker stores the record's own `when=` stamp, so
# a NEW reap re-arms the notice while the old one stays on disk for forensics
# -- deleting the record to silence the notice would throw away the evidence
# the record exists to preserve.

# Container is up + backpack install (if any) is done. This launcher now
# becomes the manager window: it lands on the dashboard, which holds the
# container alive via the same /tmp/.launcher-alive heartbeat (every 2
# minutes, well within the container's 5-minute reap window) and exposes
# the launch-claude + shutdown-all hotkeys. Closing this window — or the
# dashboard's [q] — stops the heartbeat; the container reaps itself within
# ~5 minutes (Decision #17, unchanged). On a non-TTY / no-Term::ReadKey
# terminal it degrades to the plain scrolling heartbeat loop.
#
# 08-launcher-screens: HANDOVER, not teardown. enter_dashboard's own
# enter_raw re-enters the alt screen, so emitting the leave bytes here and
# the enter bytes a moment later would show the operator a flash of the
# normal screen. host_handover releases ownership without emitting anything,
# leaving the alt screen continuously owned; enter_raw's ReadMode and title
# push are idempotent in effect.

# _machine_state() -> the podman-machine reading, as one of the six words
# Dashboard::classify_machine_state defines (s12 spec 09 S2.8). It disambiguates
# an empty container probe: with the machine up, "no such container" really means
# the container was removed; with the machine down it means we simply cannot
# tell, and a recovery must attempt the start rather than declare a rebuild
# (Dashboard::classify_container_state consumes exactly this vocabulary).
#
# NEVER dies and never blocks forever: it is called from enter_dashboard's
# pre-loop guard AND from the recover sequence's first stage, both of which run
# on the TUI's own thread of control. A wedged podman must degrade to 'unknown'
# instead of freezing the dashboard, hence the _run_timed bound.
#
# This is now only the IMPURE SHELL: run the bounded probe, hand the bytes over.
# The parse moved to Dashboard.pm because launcher.pl is not loadable by a test
# (spec S6/E2), so a parser living here can never have a behavioural oracle --
# which is exactly how four MAJOR defects survived a 651/651 green suite
# (red-team step 6). t/47 AC-31..AC-33 now cover the parse directly.

#
# The machine + host probes are Windows-only: `podman machine` is meaningless
# on Linux and there is no host shell to query, so those keys are simply
# absent, gather never invokes them, and those fields degrade to n/a — which
# is exactly how the panel renders inside the Linux container itself.
#
# The machine probe additionally requires podman: `machine list` does not
# exist under docker, so spawning it there would burn a subprocess every 23s
# to produce the same n/a. Guard mirrors the precedent at the SANDBOX_HOST_IP
# capture above.
#
# The CIM commands' -OperationTimeoutSec 3 is one wall-clock cap in this
# package; the OTHER is the literal `timeout 5` below, covering the three
# podman backticks (stats / system df / machine list). podman's CLI itself
# offers no timeout flag, and a blocking backtick is not portably
# interruptible from INSIDE perl -- so the bound comes from wrapping the
# external command in the in-repo `timeout N cmd` idiom instead (already used
# at bp-baseline.pl:266; /usr/bin/timeout is present on this host and exits
# 124 on expiry). The bound is a literal integer, not a variable -- it must
# appear in the SOURCE TEXT for it to be a real, auditable guarantee.
#
# 03-resources-reader-model fix-batch (reviewer MAJOR-1 / red-team H2): a
# hung podman/WSL backend used to block a probe backtick FOREVER, and because
# _resources_sampler_main's kill(0,$owner_pid) liveness gate is only checked
# ONCE PER ROUND (at the top of its loop), a stuck round meant the gate could
# never fire again -- the sampler became unkillable even after its owning
# launcher died. Bounding every podman probe here restores the once-per-round
# gate to being an ACTUALLY-working gate: a round can no longer last forever,
# so the loop always returns to the kill(0,...) check within a bounded time.
# _gnu_timeout() -> an absolute-path `timeout` prefix, or '' if none is usable.
#
# `timeout 5 podman ...` WAS RESOLVING TO C:\Windows\System32\timeout.exe.
#
# That is not GNU coreutils' timeout, it is Windows' pause command -- it takes
# /T, rejects `5 podman ...` outright, and every probe died on argument syntax
# before podman was ever invoked:
#
#     ERROR: Invalid syntax. Default option is not allowed more than '1' time(s).
#     Type "TIMEOUT /?" for usage.
#
# This is why the operator's Resources panel had six probes present, six probes
# run, and fifteen undef facts. It went undiagnosed for as long as it did
# because every probe ended in 2>/dev/null, so the message above had nowhere to
# go; capturing probe stderr surfaced it on the first launch afterwards.
#
# WHY IT ONLY BITES HERE. Run from Git Bash, a bare `timeout` finds
# /usr/bin/timeout and works -- which is why it survived testing. The sampler
# is exec'd from a launcher started by the PowerShell wrapper, so it inherits
# the WINDOWS PATH, where System32 comes first and /usr/bin may not appear at
# all. The command was correct; the environment it ran in was not the one it
# was written for.
#
# So: never a bare name. Resolve it beside $^X (Git for Windows ships perl and
# coreutils in the same bin), then the conventional POSIX path, and if neither
# exists return '' -- an unbounded probe is worse than no probe only if it
# hangs, and every caller already has its own round cadence and a dead-sampler
# fact. Memoised; this is asked once per probe per round.

# ===========================================================================
# t02-spend-persistence — the detached spend sampler (blueprint Decision 13).
#
# WHY A SAMPLER AT ALL. A run-independent snapshot path that nothing writes is
# still an empty panel, so Decision 11 is inert without a writer that runs
# outside a fleet run. The launcher is the only thing present in an interactive
# session, so it has to be the one to start it.
#
# WHY NOT ON THE RENDER TICK. Package s17 spent itself removing the one
# recurring fork from the render path, on a platform where forking is a
# documented failure mode ("Can't fork, trying again in 5 seconds"), and
# _gather_spend's own header records that a network fork there could block the
# TUI for the length of a timeout. That constraint stands untouched: the render
# tick stays a pure reader, and ONE detached child does the polling.
#
# WHY THE CADENCE IS SAFE EVEN IF THIS LOOP IS WRONG. bp-spend.pl's snapshot
# verb carries a CROSS-PROCESS cadence floor derived from the existing
# snapshot's mtime -- built precisely so the verb is safe to call on any tick.
# Inside that window it is a stat plus a read and makes no network call. So the
# providers cannot be hammered by an interval mistake here; the worst case is a
# wasted subprocess.
# ===========================================================================

# How often the sampler asks. Deliberately shorter than bp-spend.pl's own
# 900-second floor and deliberately not equal to it: the floor is the authority
# on when a FETCH happens, and this interval only decides how often we give it
# the chance. Naming a number equal to the floor would make the two look like
# one mechanism and invite someone to "simplify" by deleting the floor.

#
# NO ORPHAN REAPER, and that is a deliberate difference from the resources
# sampler rather than an omission. The owner-liveness check below already
# bounds an orphan's life to one cadence, and the three teardown paths
# (INT/TERM/END) kill the child directly. What the resources reaper exists for
# is the case those do not cover -- a launcher killed so hard that END never
# ran, leaving a sampler whose owner pid may since have been RECYCLED, so that
# kill(0) keeps succeeding against an unrelated process. That window exists
# here too, and is recorded rather than papered over: the cost of hitting it is
# one idle process waking every five minutes to run a subprocess that its own
# cadence floor turns into a stat and a read. The resources sampler runs a full
# probe round on every wake, which is why it earned a reaper and this does not.
# If the cost assessment ever changes, Resources::sampler_reap_decision is

# THE CONTAINER-STATE SAMPLER.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. The dashboard's gather ran FOUR podman subprocesses inline on
# the render tick, throttled to one round per $CONTAINER_POLL_SECONDS:
#
#     podman inspect --format {{.State.Status}}    the container's state
#     podman exec <ctr> stat -c %Y /tmp/.butler-busy   the busy lease's mtime
#     podman exec <ctr> date +%s                       the container's clock
#     podman machine list                              the VM's state
#
# Backticks, so the loop stopped dead until each returned. `podman exec` on
# Windows crosses into the WSL VM and then into the container; two of them
# back to back, with an inspect and a machine list, is easily seconds. A
# keystroke or a resize landing on that round waited behind all four -- which
# is exactly the "scrolling sometimes takes multiple seconds" the operator
# reported, and why it was intermittent rather than constant.
#
# The launcher's own comment had conceded the deferral for a long time:
# "podman inspect is comparatively expensive; cache it so the input loop stays
# responsive. (B3 may make the inspect fully async.)"
#
# This is that, following the pattern the resources and spend samplers already
# established: a detached child does the probing on its own cadence and writes
# a snapshot; the tick reads the file. The render loop spawns nothing.

# launcher.pl is the running process -- signal handlers, raw mode, child pids,

# landed in launcher.pl, the operator pressed [r], and got
# "[r] no module changed on disk" -- which was TRUE, correct, and completely
# irrelevant to the fix they were trying to pick up. The banner said nothing had
# changed while the thing they needed had changed and simply was not being
# watched.

# the gather round that already stats thirteen files.

# Operator: "I want the reload to be able to help without needing to relaunch?"

# launcher.pl genuinely cannot be hot-RELOADED -- it is the running process, and
# swapping subs underneath a live signal handler, raw-mode terminal and set of
# child pids is not something a stash restore can undo. But the process can
# REPLACE ITSELF: exec() keeps the pid, the terminal and the container (a
# separate process tree) while running the new code from line one. That gives
# [r] the outcome asked for without pretending the frozen call stack is
# reloadable.
#
# COMPILE-GATED, exactly like a module swap and for a sharper reason: a module
# that fails leaves the rest of the TUI running, while a broken launcher exec'd
# here takes the whole dashboard down with no way back. The same `perl -c`
# subprocess decides, and its reason is reported.
#
# CHILDREN ARE STOPPED FIRST. exec preserves the pid, so the samplers' owner-pid

# ⚠ KNOWN GAP, ESCALATED, NOT PAPERED OVER: b36 does not currently WRITE such a
# snapshot. It emits `spend_fetch` events through BpLog (outcome and status, not
# figures) and returns its struct in-process to its caller. Until b36 persists
# one, this returns undef and the Spend panel is simply ABSENT — never wrong,
# never a fabricated zero. Deciding that artifact's location, lifecycle and
# redaction belongs to b36, whose defining constraint is that the OpenCode
# session cookie is the broadest secret in the system: a persisted spend
# snapshot must provably never carry it. That is not a call to make inside a
# rendering package. See the b37 ledger.

# _row_time_key($row) -> seconds-since-local-midnight | undef (private helper
# for the s16 cross-source interleave). recent_events rows don't carry a raw
# epoch, only the already-rendered "HH:MM:SS  " muted span (Dashboard.pm's
# _event_time), so that is the best-effort comparable key LaunchLog::merge_by_key
# needs. Unparseable -> undef, which merge_by_key treats as "keep this source's
# own append order" rather than as an error.
# _row_time_key($row) -> seconds-since-midnight, or undef.
#
# The caller-supplied key extractor for LaunchLog::merge_by_key (s16 spec S1.1).
# Best-effort by construction: rendered rows carry no raw epoch, only the muted
# HH:MM:SS span, so this recovers what is there.
#
# TWO KNOWN LIMITATIONS, recorded rather than left for the next reader to
# rediscover. Both are bounded by the spec's ordering ruling (S1): within a
# source, append order is authoritative and is NEVER violated -- merge_by_key is
# stable and only ever compares the two sources' HEADS, so neither limitation can
# reorder a source's own events. Only CROSS-SOURCE placement is affected, which
# the ruling already declares best-effort.
#
#   1. MIDNIGHT WRAP. This key resets to 0 at midnight, so for the rest of that
#      tick an event at 00:00:05 (key 5) sorts before one at 23:59:55 (key
#      86395). Unlike clock skew this is systematic, not occasional: any run
#      crossing midnight hits it, and this blueprint documents 13-hour fleet
#      runs. The visible symptom is a handful of fleet events appearing slightly
#      early in the panel around the boundary -- never a scrambled source.
#      Fixing it properly means carrying a raw epoch on the row, which changes a
#      structure s06 owns and that t/41's 453 assertions pin; that is a
#      deliberate escalation, not a silent widening.
#
#   2. COUPLING TO RENDERED TEXT. This parses display output to recover a sort
#      key. s17 is next on this same panel; if it changes the leading timestamp
#      span, this returns undef, the merge degrades to source-order fallback,
#      and NOTHING FAILS LOUDLY. Whoever touches that rendering must re-check
#      here.
