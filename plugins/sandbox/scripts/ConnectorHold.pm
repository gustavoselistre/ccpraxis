package ConnectorHold;
# Fix 3 — a connector window must not vanish silently when the sandbox dies.
#
# The dashboard's [c] hotkey spawns a fresh Windows Terminal tab running
# `claude-sandbox --session`, which connects via `podman exec -it ... claude`.
# When the podman engine or the container dies mid-session the exec drops,
# `claude` exits nonzero, and (historically) the launcher did `exit $rc` — so
# Windows Terminal closed the tab with no explanation. The conversation was
# always SAFE (session jsonl is written to claude-home/ continuously), but the
# user lost their window and any context about WHY.
#
# This module is the PURE decision + the diagnostic message. The launcher does
# the actual State.Status probe and the keypress-hold; keeping the decision and
# the wording here makes both unit-testable on the host with no container.

# should_hold_window($claude_rc, $container_state) -> 1|0
#   Hold the window open ONLY when claude exited nonzero AND the container is no
#   longer running — i.e. the connection was LOST (engine/container died). We do
#   NOT hold on:
#     - a clean user quit (rc 0), whatever the container state, and
#     - a claude-level error while the container is STILL running (rc != 0 but
#       state 'running') — that's not a lost sandbox, and the existing
#       tab-closes behavior is fine there.
#   $container_state is podman's `{{.State.Status}}` string: 'running',
#   'exited', 'stopped', or ''/undef when `inspect` found no such container
#   (it was removed) — all of the latter mean "not running".

# The connector ran `claude` (a full-screen TUI). When the `podman exec` dropped
# (engine/container death) claude was killed WITHOUT its normal teardown, so the
# terminal modes it had turned ON are still on: mouse reporting (?1000 click,
# ?1002 drag, ?1003 any-motion, plus the ?1006 SGR / ?1015 urxvt encodings) and
# focus-event reporting (?1004). With those live, merely CLICKING the tab to
# focus it (or moving the mouse across it) makes the terminal emit an escape
# sequence — which the hold's key-read consumed, so the window vanished the
# instant the user touched it. Turn those modes (and bracketed paste ?2004) back
# off so no stray sequence is generated, then wait for a real Enter. Disabling a
# mode that wasn't on is a harmless no-op.
