package SpendPanel;
# Turns b36's (BpSpend) per-provider spend structs -- plus a third, Claude,
# meter this panel shows even though b36 does not produce it (spec S2) -- into
# a render-ready struct for the TUI panel and the statusline
# (b37-spend-surfaces).
#
# PURE module, following TokenInfo.pm's contract exactly (spec S1): no file
# I/O (no open/stat/-e), no time()/localtime/gmtime anywhere in this file --
# "now" is always an argument, even though this module happens not to need it
# today (every input field here is an already-computed snapshot, not
# something whose age this module derives). Never dies on any input (total
# function). Loaded by launcher.pl only; Dashboard.pm does NOT load it
# (Dashboard renders the already-computed struct via Dashboard::_spend_lines,
# never talking to SpendPanel directly -- exactly the TokenInfo/_token_lines
# split).
#
# See specs/b37-spend-surfaces-spec.md S0/S0.1/S1 for the binding contract.
#
# CONTRACT (invented here, minimal and TokenInfo.pm-shaped, per
# t/spend-panel.t's own header):

#   does not exist (spec S0.1's recorded substitution): it collapses into
#   unreadable, since a configured-but-silent provider now means "failed to
#   read", not "permanently has nothing to show".

# SpendPanel::from_snapshot(\%persisted) -> \%spend. PUBLIC, pure, total.
#
# THE TRANSLATION THIS MODULE'S OWN HEADER ALREADY NAMED AND NOBODY BUILT.
# Read that header: \%spend is described as "composed by launcher.pl from
# BpSpend::fetch() for go/zen, and from bp-usage-gate.pl's own $parsed for
# claude". That composition step was designed for an in-process caller. When
# persistence was wired in later, launcher.pl's _gather_spend was pointed at
# the FILE and handed the decoded bytes straight to status() -- and the file is
# not in that shape.
#
#   what write_snapshot persists:  { generated_at => ISO,
#                                    results => [ { provider => 'go', ... }, ... ] }
#   what status() indexes:         { go => {...}, zen => {...}, claude => {...},
#                                    zen_enabled => 0|1 }
#
# An ARRAY keyed by a provider FIELD, versus a hash keyed by provider NAME. So
# $spend->{go} was always undef and every provider degraded -- go to 'absent',
# zen to 'disabled', claude to 'unreadable' -- no matter what had actually been
# fetched. Measured, not inferred: a snapshot in the writer's format carrying
# go five_hour 42/100 and zen balance 12.34 rendered absent/disabled; the same
# figures in this function's output render ok/ok.
#
# BOTH SHAPES ARE JUSTIFIED WHERE THEY ARE, which is why this is an adapter and
# not a change to either side. The writer's array form is what makes its field
# whitelist structural (_whitelist_result runs per result). The reader's keyed
# form is what an in-process composer naturally produces. The missing piece was
# always the bridge.
#
# Rules, each of which is a distinction status() can actually see:
#   * a result whose provider is not one of claude/go/zen is DROPPED, never
#     guessed at -- a newer bp-spend.pl must not be able to inject a key here;
#   * a provider absent from `results` is ABSENT from the output, never
#     materialised as {} -- status() reads a missing key as "we never looked"
#     and a present-but-empty hash as "we looked and found nothing";
#   * zen_enabled is DERIVED, because it never appears in the persisted format
#     and defaulting it to 0 renders a successfully-fetched zen as `disabled`
#     -- the wrong word for "we have figures";
#   * generated_at is deliberately not forwarded: status() takes no age and
#     derives none (see its own comment), so passing it would be inert.
