#!/usr/bin/env bash
# heartbeat.sh — the sandbox container's entrypoint keep-alive loop (B6).
#
# Extracted from the former inline Containerfile one-liner so the reap decision
# is a PURE, unit-testable function (reap_decision) instead of untestable inline
# bash. Behavior vs. the old entrypoint is unchanged EXCEPT: when the heartbeat
# goes stale (`/tmp/.launcher-alive` older than HB) AND a butler run is live, the
# container no longer HARD-kills the run — it signals a fleet-wide graceful
# shutdown (the A4 gate's `runs/.shutdown`, written into every active blueprint),
# waits a grace window for coordinators to park cleanly, and reaps as soon as the
# run clears (or at the grace deadline). No active run → reaps at the HB
# threshold. HB, the grace window, the tick, and the startup grace are all kept
# deliberately loose (10 min / 10 min / 60s / 10 min) so a transient blip — a
# host display-off drift, a slow tick, a momentary manager stall — never trips a
# reap; B6 only makes an actual prolonged-manager-loss reap gentler
# (Decisions #6 / #28).
#
# Sourcing this file (for tests) defines the functions but does NOT run the loop
# (the `main` guard at the bottom keys off BASH_SOURCE==$0).

# SO_REUSEADDR, tested both ways. So the bridge made the port unbindable by the
# listener it existed to serve: socat running meant Claude Code could not bind
# ("OAuth callback port 9060 is already in use"), and socat killed meant the
# listener bound but nothing could reach it. There was no third state.

# It also squatted ten ports of every block for the container's whole life, so
