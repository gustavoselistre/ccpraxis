#!/usr/bin/env bash
# guard-subagent-stall.sh — refuse to end a turn that dispatched a background
# subagent without arming a stall guard for it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# A background subagent that hangs or dies silently never wakes the session. The
# harness notifies on completion; it does not notify on "never completed". So an
# unattended run dispatches a worker, ends the turn, and simply stops — and the
# operator finds it hours later. This has happened repeatedly, and the fix was
# repeatedly written down as guidance: dispatch, then arm a bounded guard.
#
# Guidance did not hold. That is not a surprise in this repo: guard-git-mutations.sh
# exists because a prohibited `git stash` destroyed a completed fix-batch that a
# written instruction was supposed to protect. The thesis there applies here —
# A WRITTEN INSTRUCTION IS NOT AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. So this is a gate.
#
# HOW IT WORKS — A STATE MACHINE, NOT A DETECTOR
#
# Two earlier versions of this gate were detectors, and both were wrong in the
# same way. The first cleared the alarm when a Bash command merely CONTAINED a
# token, so a guard that died on launch satisfied it. The second read the
# closing prose for "next I'll ...", which can be sidestepped by rephrasing a
# sentence. A detector is only ever as good as its guesses.
#
# So the default is inverted. The gate is INERT until a run demonstrably
# starts, and from then on the turn may not end until the agent RESOLVES the
# run — explicitly, with a verb:
#
#   PostToolUse/Task  — a background dispatch ACTIVATES the run (and is
#                       recorded by name, so the denial can name it).
#   PostToolUse/Bash  — a director tick whose RESPONSE handed back work also
#                       activates. Activation is never something the agent must
#                       remember to do.
#   Stop              — state active? DENY. Only `bp-runstate.pl finish` or a
#                       verified `bp-runstate.pl pause` resolves it.
#
# Silence is not a resolution, and neither is a plausible sentence. A pause
# must name a watcher pid that is RUNNING and a deadline in the FUTURE, both
# verified at read time; a pause whose watcher dies reverts to active by
# itself, so it cannot hold the gate open after it stops meaning anything.
#
# DELIBERATELY NOT GATED. There is no bp_hook_gate call here, by design and for
# the same reason guard-git-mutations.sh has none: bp_hook_gate exits 0 unless
# BP_LEDGER/BP_DIR/BP_PROJECT_ROOT are set, and those are exported only by
# bp-launch.sh into headless coordinators. A drive-solo run — the exact place
# subagents are dispatched by hand and the exact place this failure has bitten —
# would open the gate and enforce nothing. See coordinator-protocol/SKILL.md,
# "…but only inside a butler-LAUNCHED coordinator".
#
# FAIL-OPEN, ON PURPOSE. Every unexpected condition (no JSON parser, unwritable
# state dir, unreadable payload) exits 0 and allows the turn to end. A guard that
# can wedge a session is worse than the stall it prevents: the stall costs
# latency, a wedge costs the run. The one thing it will not do is fail open
# SILENTLY on the case it exists for — a pending dispatch always denies.

        # CEREMONY, NOT FUNCTION: a guard that exits immediately, watches the
        # wrong path, or is syntactically broken contains the token just as well
        # as a working one. It is the same vacuity trap this repo keeps paying
        # for -- a check that cannot fail (see bp-ledger.pl's
        # INSTALLED+SKIPPED+FAILED==ITEMS identity, package a03).
        #
        # A guard now proves itself instead, through bp-runstate.pl's `pause`,
        # which refuses a watcher pid that is not running or a deadline that is
        # not in the future. Ceremony cannot satisfy it.
        #
        # What DOES happen here is the second activation trigger: a director
        # tick that handed back work means a run is underway, whether or not a
        # subagent was dispatched. Reading the RESPONSE (not the command) is
        # deliberate -- the command only says what was asked, the response says
        # what came back.
        #
        # `run-package` ONLY. `need-order` used to activate here too, and that
        # was wrong in a way that produced a closed loop.
        #
        # `need-order` is not work handed back -- it is the director DECLINING
        # to choose, because the answer belongs to the operator (e.g. two
        # delivered blueprints and no order covering them: `scope-extends-order`).
        # Nothing is underway, so there is nothing for a Stop gate to protect.
        # Worse: an agent that consults the director to CHECK whether anything
        # is pending was reactivating the very run it had just finished. The
        # diagnostic mutated the thing being diagnosed, and the session could
        # not leave: finish -> consult -> reactivate -> blocked stop -> finish.
        # Observed 2026-08-24.
        #
        # This loses nothing. When a drive is genuinely underway and hits
        # need-order, the run is ALREADY active and activation is a no-op --
        # activation only has an effect on a run that is idle or finished, and
        # that is exactly the false positive.
        # ...but the response alone is NOT ENOUGH, and reading it alone was a
        # third bug of the same family, observed the same day.
        #
        # This matched the TEXT of any Bash output. So a command that merely
        # PRINTED the pattern activated a run: a grep over this hook's own
        # source, a `cat` of it, a test run echoing its fixtures, a commit
        # message quoting it. Investigating the escalation machinery started a
        # run about the escalation machinery -- and the session then could not
        # end, because a diagnostic had manufactured the state the Stop gate
        # exists to protect.

    # Closes almanac report 20260819-014748-0b41, filed against this hook: the
    # state file was append-only and nothing ever truncated it, so the denial
    # message below listed EVERY background dispatch of the whole session under
    # the heading "this turn". By the end of a long unattended run that is fifty
    # entries, most of them hours old and already resolved -- noise that buries
    # the two lines an operator actually needs to read.
    #
    # It is the same shape as the defect package t07 exists to fix in
    # runs/escalations/: broad write, no clear. The rule that resolves both is the
    # same one -- clear when the thing the record was tracking is demonstrably
    # over -- and here that moment is unambiguous: an ALLOWED Stop means the run
    # was resolved (finished, or paused behind a watcher whose pid and deadline
    # bp-runstate.pl verified), so every dispatch recorded up to now is
    # accounted for.
    #
    # DELIBERATELY NOT CLEARED ON A DENIED STOP. A dispatch made two turns ago
    # and still unresolved is still unresolved, and dropping it would hide
