# bp_read_payload [FAIL_MODE] -- read the hook payload from stdin, BOUNDED, into
# the global PAYLOAD. FAIL_MODE is 'closed' (default) or 'open' and decides what
# happens if stdin never reaches EOF.
#
# CALL IT BARE -- `bp_read_payload closed` -- NEVER as `PAYLOAD=$(bp_read_payload)`.
# Command substitution runs it in a SUBSHELL, where its `exit 2` would terminate
# only that subshell: the hook would continue, with an empty payload, having
# printed a denial nobody acted on. That is the same subshell trap
# guard-git-mutations.sh records beside its own git_scan_target call, and the
# reason both communicate through a global instead of stdout.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every hook here used `PAYLOAD=$(cat)`, an UNBOUNDED read. When
# stdin reaches EOF -- which is what Claude Code's own hook dispatch does -- that
# is correct and instant. When stdin is an inherited pipe that never closes, cat
# blocks FOREVER at essentially zero CPU, and nothing upstream notices.
#
# That is not hypothetical. Bug report 20260828-095201-7c1e: a perl.exe running a
# throwaway probe out of a session scratchpad was found alive NINE DAYS after the
# session that spawned it had exited, having burnt 0.016s of CPU in total --
# blocked on a read, holding 11 MB and 135 handles, orphaned, with nothing in
# ccpraxis tracking or reaping it. Reproduced directly against
# guard-git-mutations.sh: with stdin closed it exits 0 at once; with stdin a pipe
# that never closes it blocks until killed.
#
# Note what this does NOT claim. The report guessed the probe had wedged on one
# of five specific payloads; replaying that probe shows it does not -- all five
# classify correctly in seconds. The defect is the unbounded read itself, and it
# was in NINE hooks, so it is fixed once, here.
#
# NOT `timeout`. On the Windows host a bare `timeout` resolves to
# C:\Windows\System32\timeout.exe -- the *pause* command -- which rejects these
# arguments outright. That exact mistake is bug report 20260825-193930-fff0,
# where it silently killed all six resources probes before their commands ran.
# `read -t` is a bash builtin: no PATH, no external binary, nothing to resolve.
#
# `read -r -d ''` reads to EOF (no NUL can appear -- JSON escapes U+0000 as the
# six ASCII bytes \u0000, which is what ledger-guard.sh depends on), returns 1 at
# EOF with the data intact, and >128 only on timeout. One difference from $(cat)
# is recorded rather than hidden: $(cat) strips trailing newlines and this does
# not. No JSON parser cares.
#
# The timeout is deliberately far longer than any real payload needs -- a Write
# tool_input can be hundreds of KB, and this must never fire on a slow-but-live
# producer. If it fires at all, the alternative was hanging forever.

# the host they blocked EVERY Edit/Write and EVERY Bash call, in every session,
# forever. A guard that cannot run on the host is not a guard, it is an outage.

# both of which genuinely resolve. Rejecting either would disable the
# registry for a legitimate environment, which is worse than the bug this
# fixes. A trailing slash, embedded spaces, non-ASCII characters, and even an
# embedded newline after the leading slash/drive-letter are all accepted
# verbatim — they are properties of a real path, not evidence of relativity.

# finished, so two settled runs on this machine armed the Stop gate for every
# future session in those trees, forever. And it says yes for sessions that are

# bp_continuity_active_dir -> echoes the machine-level registry of ARMED

#
# ── THE SINGLE PATH-RESOLUTION RULE (fix-batch F1, spec SS2.6/AC-13) ────────
# Three components resolve this same registry path: this function (bash,
# gate-continuity.sh's caller), bp-continuity.pl's continuity_active_dir
# (perl, the arm/disarm/status CLI), and scripts/statusline.pl's own inline
# copy (perl, standalone, cannot require this file). They previously diverged
# on what "$HOME is unset" means (`$PWD`, `$USERPROFILE`, and `.`
# respectively) — three plausible-but-different guesses that could silently
# disagree about whether a session is watched, which is the worst possible
# failure for a feature whose entire point is "know that you are being
# watched". ALL THREE now follow this exact order and must not drift again:
#   1. CCPRAXIS_CONTINUITY_ACTIVE_DIR, if set and non-empty — wins outright.
#   2. else $HOME, if set and non-empty.
#   3. else $USERPROFILE (the Windows fallback), if set and non-empty.
#   4. else: NO resolvable directory. This function returns 1 with NOTHING
#      on stdout — it refuses to guess (no $PWD, no '.'). The two WRITE
#      paths (bp-continuity.pl arm/disarm/status) must fail LOUDLY on this
#      (STATUS: error, exit 1) rather than silently write/read a marker
#      under an unpredictable path. The two READ paths that must never hard
#      -fail a Stop/statusline (this function's callers in
#      bp_continuity_marker/bp_continuity_any_active, and
#      scripts/statusline.pl's badge) instead FAIL SAFE: "unresolvable"
#      means "treat as nothing armed" (gate never blocks; badge never shows
#      WATCHED). This is not a fourth divergent guess — it is consistent
#      with rule 4's write-side refusal: if the directory could never be
#      resolved, arm() could never have written a marker there either, so
#      there is never a live marker for these fail-safe reads to miss.
