#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ledger-guard.sh — PreToolUse package-ledger write-integrity guard (b12).
#
# Validates the PROSPECTIVE RESULTING CONTENT of any coordinator write that
# lands on $BP_DIR/packages/*.md, and blocks (exit 2 + exactly one stderr line)
# when that result would be corrupt in one of five ways: a control byte, a
# broken frontmatter block, a missing required frontmatter key, an out-of-set
# status:, or a dropped required "##" section heading. See
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-butler-overhaul/specs/b12-ledger-write-integrity-spec.md
# (§2.2 control flow, §2.4 validator contract, §2.5 reconstruction, §2.6 the
# message catalogue) — this script is the implementation of that spec.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED, deliberately, and deliberately unlike b10's repeat-guard: a
# rejected ledger write costs one coordinator retry WITH a diagnostic; an
# accepted corrupt one silently degrades the orchestrator's view of the run for
# hours (ledger_fm returns undef for every key and bp-orchestrator.pl:1039 acts
# on a stale registry status). There is NO kill switch, by design. Exit is only
# ever 0 or 2; nothing is ever written to stdout. No `set -e`, and no
# `trap ... EXIT` (either would clobber the deliberate exit 2).
#
# WHY THE VALIDATOR IS PERL AND NOT BASH+JQ (spec §2.3): a bash variable cannot
# hold a NUL byte and command substitution strips NULs, so a bash-only guard
# structurally could not see the very byte from the incident that created this
# package. JSON escapes U+0000 as the six ASCII bytes \u0000, so the payload
# survives $(cat) intact; the DECODED content — which does carry the raw byte —
# is never handed back to the shell. The payload reaches perl on stdin (never
# argv/env: a whole-file Write can be hundreds of KB and would risk E2BIG).
#
# UNVERIFIED ASSUMPTION (spec §2.5, §6-E6): the MultiEdit arm applies its edits
# SEQUENTIALLY against a progressively-modified buffer. Zero MultiEdit
# PreToolUse payloads exist anywhere on disk in this project, so that semantic
# is assumed, not established. It is settled only by a captured real payload or
# current Claude Code documentation. On present evidence the arm never executes.
#
# THE HIGHEST-RISK LINE IN THE FILE is the Escalation section pattern:
# ^##\s+Escalation\b — a PREFIX, never an exact string. 30/32 live ledgers
# spell it "## Escalation (when status: blocked)"; an exact check would reject
# the entire corpus INCLUDING EVERY GRACEFUL-STOP PARK-WRITE, leaving a stopping
# coordinator with no legal move at all. Do not "tidy" it.
