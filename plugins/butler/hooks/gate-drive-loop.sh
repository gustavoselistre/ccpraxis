#!/usr/bin/env bash
# gate-drive-loop.sh — Stop hook inside a /butler:drive-solo DRIVER session.
#
# THE RULE IT ENFORCES
#
#   A driver turn may end EITHER because something will wake the session
#   (a dispatched subagent, a backgrounded Bash call), OR because the
#   director says the run is settled. Never for any other reason.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS
#
# drive-solo casts the driver as "a thin loop over the director": call
# `bp-drive-next.pl next`, dispatch the action, call `next` again. That is
# prose, and prose decays over a long context. Observed three times in one
# 12-hour run (2026-08-07): a turn ends immediately after a ledger write,
# the text promises the next step, and nothing is scheduled to perform it.
# A dispatched agent notifies; a finished foreground Bash call does not. The
# run dies silently, mid-package, LOOKING finished — which is the worst
# property an unattended run can have, because the operator only discovers it
# by asking.
#
# gate-stop.sh already makes this exact argument one level down, for
# coordinators: it "converts ledger discipline from a prompt rule (which
# decays over long contexts) into a mechanical gate". But every butler hook
# begins with bp_hook_gate, which requires BP_LEDGER — exported only into
# coordinator processes. So the DRIVER, the one session nothing supervises,
# was the only participant with no stop discipline at all. This closes that.
#
# POSTURE: FAIL OPEN, ALWAYS BOUNDED
#
# A stop gate that misfires traps a human's session, which is far worse than
# a missed nudge. So: every error path exits 0; the director is called under a
# timeout; consecutive blocks are capped (MAX_BLOCKS) and then the stop is
# allowed with an explanation; and there are two explicit escape hatches.
#
# ESCAPE HATCHES

# common case (nothing driving, no reporter ever registered) costs a few
# stats and ONE fork here (d04-registry-path-one-rule: $RDIR now resolves via
# bp_reporter_active_dir, a command substitution, rather than the old inline
# HOME-or-cwd expression -- no longer literally zero forks; a registry keyed
# on the current directory is not a registry, so the guess this replaced had
# to go. bp_drive_any_active immediately below already forks once via
# bp_drive_active_dir, so the total per-Stop fork count in the common case
# goes from 1 to 2, not from 0 to 1. Accepted, not eliminated -- see the

# tells a driver to dispatch a worker or consult bp-drive-next.pl -- neither
# concept exists in a reporter's vocabulary. Training an operator to reach

# contain .ccpraxis-local-data/.drive-solo/order.json". That is yes for every
# session in a tree where drive-solo has EVER run — order.json was never
# deleted when a run finished — and yes for sessions that are not the driver
# at all. Worse, the ancestor walk did not terminate on a Windows drive-letter
# cwd (dirname("C:") == "C:"), so an unrelated session hung here until the
# hook timeout on every single stop.
#
# The right question is "is THIS session driving", and mark-wakeup.sh answers
# it by registering a session the moment it calls the director. This call
# itself is still two stats and no subprocess -- but it is no longer the
# FIRST thing this file does (fixbatch step7 / F3): the reporter-surface
# pre-check above now runs ahead of it, and PAYLOAD/stdin is read once,
# unconditionally, immediately after both cheap pre-checks pass or fail.
# So "nothing is driving anywhere AND no reporter has ever registered" is
# still cheap (a handful of stats, zero forks, no stdin read) -- but "nothing
# is driving, yet some reporter marker exists somewhere on this machine" now
# costs the reporter branch's own subprocess work even though THIS session

# already computes exactly the checkable claim: state is "paused" IFF a

# verified answer, immediately before the unconditional BLOCK below.
#
# PROVABLY INERT against t/drive-loop-gate.t section H's own fixture: that
# fixture has no .subagent-guard/run-state.json at all, so bp-runstate.pl
# status returns "inert", never "paused" — the case arm below matches

# I/O is normally fast" turning into an unbounded hang (see the comment
# above the director call). A FIFO in place of run-state.json reproduced a
# genuine indefinite hang here; a timeout expiry falls through to BLOCK,
# the same safe direction every other failure path in this fold already
# takes.
#
# fixbatch step7 / driver recommendation: PARSED, not substring-matched.
# JSON::PP escapes embedded quotes, so a crafted --reason containing the
# literal text `"state":"paused"` does NOT defeat a bash `case` substring
# match today — verified empirically — but that safety is INCIDENTAL to the
# encoder's escaping, and no oracle pins it. Decoding the JSON and testing
# the parsed `state` field removes the dependency on that incidental
# behaviour entirely, at the cost of one more perl invocation we are
# already paying for (perl is already required to reach this branch).

# KEEP THIS SHORT -- see the matching note in guard-subagent-stall.sh. This
# fires repeatedly in a long run and the rationale is already in this file's
# header and in drive-solo/SKILL.md. The pinned essentials (t/drive-loop-gate.t
# G3 and :322) are the .stop-ok escape hatch and the bp-drive-next.pl verb.

BLOCKED (butler drive-loop): nothing is scheduled to continue the run, and the
director still returns work:

    action: $ACTION ${DETAIL:+($DETAIL)}

Do it NOW, in this turn -- dispatch the worker it calls for, or run
'perl plugins/butler/scripts/bp-drive-next.pl next' and act on the result.
Describing the next step instead of doing it is what this gate catches.

If the run really should stop here: touch $DS/.stop-ok and stop again.
(Blocks at most $MAX_BLOCKS times in a row.)
