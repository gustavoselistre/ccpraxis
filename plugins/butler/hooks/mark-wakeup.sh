# mark-wakeup.sh — PreToolUse hook for Task, Agent and Bash, in a DRIVE-SOLO
# DRIVER session (never in a coordinator).
#
# Records that this turn started something that will wake the session up again:
#   * any Task or Agent dispatch (a subagent; its completion notification
#     comes back), or
#   * a Bash call with run_in_background=true (its exit notification comes back).
#
# gate-drive-loop.sh (Stop) CONSUMES this marker. The pair encodes one rule:
#
#     A driver turn may end EITHER because something will wake it,
#     OR because the director says the run is settled. Never for any
#     other reason.
#
# Why this exists. /butler:drive-solo describes the driver as "a thin loop over
# the director": call `bp-drive-next.pl next`, dispatch the action it returns,
# call `next` again. That is prose, and prose decays over a long context. The
# observed failure — three times in one 12-hour run on 2026-08-07 — is a turn
# that ends right after a ledger write, with text promising the next step and
# nothing scheduled to perform it. A dispatched agent notifies; a finished Bash
# call does not. So the run dies silently, mid-package, looking finished.
#
# This is the same argument gate-stop.sh already makes for coordinators ("converts
# ledger discipline from a prompt rule (which decays over long contexts) into a
# mechanical gate"), and the same one guard-git-mutations.sh makes in this repo's
# CLAUDE.md: a written instruction is not an enforcement mechanism.
#
# NEVER blocks anything: it only writes a marker. Exit 0 on every path.

# 2026-08-19 d03-one-shell-noise-stripper fixbatch step7, FIX 1 + FIX 2
# (redteam-step6.md CRITICAL-1/CRITICAL-2, both confirmed regressions against
# the pre-fbe7f6e raw-payload grep). The single-shot "leftmost match, then
# look at the text right before it" veto had two independent false-negative
# holes:
#   FIX 1 -- the veto anchored on the LEFTMOST occurrence of the base regex
#     in the WHOLE command, not on the occurrence that actually matched. An
#     early, harmless mention (`grep bp-drive-next.pl README.md`) vetoed a
#     later, genuine invocation in the same compound command
#     (`; perl .../bp-drive-next.pl next`), because [^"]* in the base regex
#     happily spans `;`, `&`, `|` and newline once quotes are blanked.
#   FIX 2 -- $(...), backticks and <(...) genuinely execute regardless of the
#     outer word (`echo $(perl ... next)` really runs the director; `echo`
#     does not "read" it), but the veto only ever looked at the OUTER
#     command's first word and vetoed on it.
#
# THE FIX, one mechanism for both: split the (stripped) text into SEGMENTS at
# every real command separator (`;` `&` `|` newline) AND at every
# command/process-substitution opener (`$(` backtick `<(` `>(`), then judge
# EACH segment independently -- arm if ANY non-reader segment matches. A
# reader segment can now only veto ITSELF, never a sibling segment, and
# substitution content is its own segment rather than inheriting the outer
# word's verdict. (Double-quoted $(...)/backtick content -- e.g.
# `printf "%s" "$(perl ... next)"` -- reaches this split as LIVE text too:
# see bp_strip_shell_noise's dquote handling in scripts/bp-lib.sh, which
# stopped blanking it for the same reason -- it executes regardless of the
# surrounding quotes.) This does not resolve NESTED substitutions perfectly
# (a `)` inside a further-nested string can end a segment early) -- an
# accepted heuristic limit, same class as the ones already documented below,
# and it only ever costs a potential false ARM on a pathological nesting, not
# a missed real invocation.
#
# Degrades in three independent, false-negative-averse directions (never
# toward silently missing a real invocation):
#   - bp_strip_shell_noise unavailable or empty output (perl missing,
#     bp-lib.sh unreadable) -> matches against the UNSTRIPPED extracted
#     command instead of failing closed (mirrors guard-validation-
#     interlock.sh's own bp_strip_shell_noise fallback).
#   - the extracted command exceeds $BP_WAKEUP_MAX_STRIP_BYTES -> the
#     (expensive, O(n) char-by-char) stripper is skipped entirely and the
#     RAW command is matched instead. See the size check below for why and
#     the chosen threshold.
#   - perl itself unavailable for the regex+segment-veto step -> the base
#     regex match still runs via bash grep; the segment veto is skipped
#     (never applied), which can only ARM more often, never less. NOTE
#     (fixbatch step7, FIX 5 / reviewer S1): this branch is untested on this
#     host -- bp_json_get (lib.sh) itself requires perl, and there is no jq
#     here (repo constraint), so a PATH with perl removed breaks command
#     EXTRACTION before this branch is ever reached. Reasoned-but-unexercised,
#     not verified by any test in this repo; a container with jq present
#     could isolate it, this host cannot.
#
# bp_unquote_script_paths -- reads a raw (pre-strip) shell command on stdin,
# echoes it back with the QUOTES removed from any quoted span whose ENTIRE
# content is a bare script path ending ".pl" (no whitespace, no shell
# metacharacter inside). Everything else passes through byte-for-byte.
#
# 2026-09-08, toolfix-drivesolo-arm (real drive-solo run, this host):
# bp_strip_shell_noise blanks EVERY character inside a quoted span, full
# stop -- that is correct for its stated job (hide inert quoted text from a
# substring matcher) but it also blanks a QUOTED PROGRAM PATH, which is not
# inert: the shell still executes it. A driver session that defensively
# quoted its own script path --
#   perl "C:/Users/André/.claude/ccpraxis/plugins/butler/scripts/bp-drive-next.pl" next --scope backup-driver
# -- is ordinary, correct shell (the path contains a non-ASCII character,
# and quoting a path is the standard defensive habit), yet after stripping
# the literal text "bp-drive-next.pl" no longer appears ANYWHERE in the
# result, so bp_wakeup_arm_check's regex can never match it. Confirmed live:
# this is exactly what happened in a real run on this host -- the driver was
# never registered, gate-drive-loop.sh was silently inert, and the
# statusline's "driving" badge never appeared. The documented canonical
# invocation shape (SKILL.md: `perl "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"/scripts/bp-drive-
# next.pl next`) dodges this only because just the VARIABLE is quoted, not
# the script name itself -- a coincidence of style, not a property this
# hook actually enforced.
#
# THE FIX runs BEFORE bp_strip_shell_noise, not INSIDE it: bp_strip_shell_
# noise is also guard-validation-interlock.sh's helper for an unrelated
# classification job (see that helper's own header in scripts/bp-lib.sh),
# so widening ITS quote handling would change behaviour there too, out of
# scope and unreviewed for this fix. Un-quoting is done as a narrow, local
# pre-pass instead: a quoted span only loses its quotes if its content is
# NOTHING BUT a path ending ".pl" -- once unquoted it is bare, unquoted text
# by the time bp_strip_shell_noise and the segment/reader-veto logic below
# ever see it, so every existing property (segment split, first-word veto,
# $(...)/backtick handling, size guard) applies to it exactly as it would
# to a naturally-unquoted invocation. Deliberately conservative: a quoted
# span with anything ELSE inside it (extra words, `;`/`&`/`|`/`<`/`>`/
# backtick, or content that does not end ".pl") is left untouched and still
# gets blanked by bp_strip_shell_noise exactly as before this fix -- so an
# INERT quoted mention that merely happens to contain the substring
# (`echo "perl /x/bp-drive-next.pl next"`, content has an internal space and
# does not end ".pl" at the closing quote) is still vetoed, unchanged.
#
# NOT a shell parser, same residual class as bp_strip_shell_noise itself:
# does not track surrounding comment/heredoc state. This is provably safe
# here because bp_strip_shell_noise's comment and heredoc handling blanks
# EVERY character of a comment or heredoc body regardless of quoting -- so
# a script path that this pre-pass unquotes INSIDE a comment or heredoc
# still gets blanked by the very next stage, unchanged in outcome. Also does
# not resolve escaped quotes (`\"`) inside a double-quoted span containing a
# path -- an accepted, narrow residual: no real invocation shape in this
# repo escapes a quote inside its own path.

#
# Mirrors bp_drive_marker's shape (lib.sh) but inlined -- lib.sh is outside
# this package's write set. The match requires the literal invocation, not
# merely the string: a Read of reporter/SKILL.md, a grep for bp-watch.pl, or

  # i.e. is preceded by whitespace, a command separator, or the start of the
  # string, exactly like bash's own lexer), or a heredoc body (from a <<[-]
  # operator's introducer line to its terminator line, honouring <<- 's
  # leading-tab stripping and an optional quoted delimiter). Every character
  # in any of those spans is replaced with whitespace before the substring
  # regex ever runs, so "bp-watch.pl --arm --blueprint" can only match text
  # that is actually part of the command bash would execute -- never text
  # that is quoted, commented out, or sitting inert inside a heredoc body.

# ARMING: this hook is what registers a session as a drive-solo DRIVER.
#
# A driver is not "a session in a directory where drive-solo once ran" — that
# was the old, wrong test, and it armed the Stop gate permanently for every
# session in the tree. A driver is a session that CALLS THE DIRECTOR. Nothing
# else does, and a session that never calls it is not driving no matter where
# it is running. So: see bp-drive-next.pl in a Bash command, register this
# session id; gate-drive-loop.sh then gates exactly that session and no other.
#
# Self-arming, so no skill or script has to remember to do it, and impossible
# to arm a session that never drove. The marker holds the data dir so the Stop
# hook needs no path walk of its own.
# The match requires the script AND one of its subcommands, so a command that
# merely NAMES the file -- a grep for it, an ls of the scripts dir, a sed over
# the source -- does not arm a session that is only reading about the director.
# The script rejects an empty subcommand ("usage: next|record-order|park"), so
# every real invocation carries one and nothing is lost by requiring it.
#
# The bias is deliberate and one-directional: a false POSITIVE arms a session
# that is not driving, which costs it one director call per stop and then
# disarms itself the moment the director answers 'done'. A false NEGATIVE
# leaves a real driver ungated, which is the silent mid-run death this whole
# pair exists to prevent. When in doubt, arm.
#
# 2026-08-19 d03-one-shell-noise-stripper (almanac report 20260814-093113-34a0),
# extending the bias statement above with what THIS fix specifically does and
# does not change: it closes false POSITIVES -- a MENTION of the invocation
# (echoed, commented-out, single- or double-quoted, heredoc-embedded, or bare/
# unquoted) that is never actually executed -- via bp_strip_shell_noise plus
# the reader-segment veto below. It adds NO new requirement on how a genuine
# invocation may be shaped: subcommand choice (next|record-order|park), exact
# script path (relative, absolute, or quoted), a `cd ... &&` prefix, extra CLI
# flags before or after the subcommand, and a trailing pipe all continue to
# arm, exactly as before (see AC8 in the package spec for the enumerated
# shapes this is pinned against).
#
# THREAT MODEL, ruled explicitly (same ruling as w03 for
# guard-validation-interlock.sh, mirrored here rather than re-derived):
# ACCIDENT, not ADVERSARY. Nothing in this repo's design treats a driver
# session as trying to defeat its own gate -- every dispatcher of the Bash
# command this block can see is a butler worker or an interactive driver
# following its own protocol, not an attacker.
#
# ACCEPTED RESIDUALS, not fixed here:
#   - 2026-08-19 fixbatch step7: the previous bullet here claimed $(...) and
#     backtick spans were unresolved and could slip an invocation past this
#     block. That is no longer true (FIX 1 / FIX 2 above; redteam-step6.md
#     CRITICAL-1/CRITICAL-2) -- $(...), backticks and <(...) are now treated
#     as segment boundaries, and their content (including inside double
#     quotes -- bp_strip_shell_noise no longer blanks it) is judged like any
#     other executing segment. Inherited from bp_strip_shell_noise itself
#     (scripts/bp-lib.sh), the ONLY remaining residual of this shape is
#     VARIABLE EXPANSION: a command that builds the invocation text through a
#     variable (`X="bp-drive-next.pl next"; eval "$X"`) still slips past,
#     because nothing here evaluates shell variables. Same direction every
#     existing caller of that helper already accepts.
#   - The driver-arm-specific equivalent of `npm te''st`-style reconstitution:
#     a determined caller could still build `bp-drive-next.pl` plus a
#     subcommand through string concatenation, `eval`, a variable, or a
#     sourced function and arm (or dodge arming) without the literal
#     substring ever appearing in tool_input.command. Accepted for the same
#     reason w03 accepted its analogue: nobody has a reason to spell the
#     director's own invocation that way under the ACCIDENT threat model, and
#     the false-negative bias above means this residual leans toward ARMING a
#     hard-to-classify command, not silently missing a driver.
#
# g01: this block, and its own .drive-solo gate, are UNTOUCHED in effect
# (spec §2.4) -- a drive-solo run must already have an order dir before a
# director call can register a driver here. Only the wake-up-write section
# below (post-ARMING) is restructured to add an independent, unconditional
# continuity write.

# --- continuity: NOTHING IS WRITTEN HERE ANY MORE ----------------------------
#
# This hook used to stamp `<epoch> <ToolName>` into
# <continuity-marker>.wakeup-pending on every Task dispatch or backgrounded Bash
# call, so that an armed session could end its turn on the strength of having
# dispatched something. gate-continuity.sh no longer accepts that, and the
# reason is the whole point of the change: a dispatch records that something
# STARTED, never that anything will come back. A subagent that runs forever, or
# a background command with no timeout, wrote exactly this marker and then never
# returned, leaving the session idle with nothing left to re-invoke it.
#
# Since the gate now requires field 2 to be the literal `bounded` (written only
# by `bp-continuity.pl hold`, which sleeps to its own deadline and exits), a
# marker written here could never permit a stop again. It had two effects left,
# both harmful:
#
#   * it CLOBBERED a live bounded hold. The write was truncating (`>`), so a
#     dispatch made after taking a hold destroyed the hold's deadline and left
#     `<epoch> <ToolName>` in its place -- and the documented workflow is
#     exactly that order ("take a bounded wait alongside whatever you
#     dispatched"). Verified: hold, then dispatch, then Stop => BLOCKED.
#   * it made the gate delete a file this hook had just created, once per turn,
#     for nothing.
#
# So `hold` is the sole writer of that file now. The .drive-solo path above is
# untouched -- it has its own consumer with its own contract.
