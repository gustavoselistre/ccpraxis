# guard-blueprint-write.sh — PreToolUse hook (b43-blueprint-write-api).
#
# Denies a direct Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit targeting any blueprint.md path,
# forcing every mutation through bp-blueprint.pl's typed, validated, atomic write API
# (add-package/set-deps/add-decision/set-field). Every hand-splice of
# blueprint.md to date has been correct by luck, never by construction (b43 spec
# preamble) — this hook is what makes "correct by construction" the only legal path.
# `set-status` is retired (s03: the table has no `status` column any more) — do not
# point remediation advice at a verb that only refuses.
#
# Deliberately UNLIKE ledger-guard.sh/guard-writes.sh: this hook does NOT call
# bp_hook_gate and is NOT scoped to a coordinator session. A hand-edit to
# blueprint.md is dangerous in ANY session, not only inside a running coordinator,
# and the b43 oracle (t/86) invokes this hook directly with no BP_* env vars set —
# gating on BP_LEDGER here would make every G9 assertion vacuously pass (always
# allow) rather than actually proving denial.
#
# Must NOT deny the API's own writer: bp-blueprint.pl is invoked via Bash, and this
# hook only inspects Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit tool_name payloads, so a Bash
# invocation of the writer is never even inspected -- it exits 0 immediately.
#
# Exit 0 = allow. Exit 2 = block; stderr fed back to the model.
