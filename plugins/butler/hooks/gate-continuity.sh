# gate-continuity.sh — Stop hook for an EXPLICITLY-ARMED continuity session.
#
# THE RULE IT ENFORCES
#
#   Once a session has been explicitly armed (perl bp-continuity.pl arm, or
#   /butler:continuity on), a turn may end EITHER because something will wake
#   the session (a dispatched Task/Agent, a backgrounded Bash call), OR
#   because the session has been explicitly DISARMED. Never for any other
#   reason.
#
# WHY THIS IS A NEW, DIRECTOR-FREE GATE, not a re-arming of gate-drive-loop.sh
# or gate-headless-background.sh: see
# specs/g01-explicit-continuity-arming-spec.md SS1/SS2.5. There is no oracle
# for "is this non-blueprint session's work done" — settlement is explicit
# disarm only. This file never stubs, requires, or reads bp-drive-next.pl,
# and reads BP_LEDGER in exactly one place, below, as a top-of-file
# short-circuit — never as a branching signal for block/allow.
#
# WHY THERE IS NO bp_hook_gate CALL HERE (fix-batch F2) — this is DELIBERATE,
# not an omission to "fix" by adding one. Every butler hook begins with
# bp_hook_gate, which requires BP_LEDGER — exported only into coordinator
# processes (see gate-drive-loop.sh's own header for the identical argument
# one level down, for the driver). This gate exists PRECISELY for the
# opposite case: a session with NO blueprint, NO drive-solo, NO reporter —
# i.e. one bp_hook_gate would refuse outright. Adding a bp_hook_gate call
# here would make this file live ONLY inside a coordinator process, which is
# the one class of session that arm already refuses to watch (cmd_arm's
# BP_LEDGER check, and the defense-in-depth BP_LEDGER check a few lines
# below) — i.e. it would silently disable this entire package for every
# session it was built to cover, while still compiling, still registered,
# still "correct" by every check that doesn't actually invoke it live.
#
# POSTURE: FAIL OPEN, ALWAYS BOUNDED — same discipline as gate-drive-loop.sh.
# `source lib.sh 2>/dev/null || exit 0`: a Stop gate cannot function at all
# without the registry helpers, so failing open explicitly here is correct.
#
# ESCAPE HATCHES
#   * touch <marker>.stop-ok              — one-shot; consumed on use
#   * export CCPRAXIS_CONTINUITY_STOP_OK=1 — session-wide

# --- a wake-up is already scheduled: this turn end is legitimate -----------

# a Task/Agent dispatch or a backgrounded Bash call. CONSUME it.
#
# BUT ONLY IF IT IS STILL PENDING (bug report 20260829-225523-88e7).
#
# The marker used to be a bare flag with no timestamp. It records that something
# was DISPATCHED, never that anything will still wake the session -- so a marker
# written for work that had already completed several turns earlier was
# consumed by a later, unrelated stop. An armed session ended a turn having just
# written "next: promote, then re-run the sync", and the operator had to ask why
# it stopped. That is precisely what this gate is for.
#
# A wake-up that was scheduled long ago has either fired or died by now; a hook
# cannot tell which, and both mean it is no longer pending. So the marker
# expires. WAKEUP_TTL_S is generous -- a genuine background task that has not
# called back within it is not something this session should be waiting on
# silently anyway.
#
# .stop-blocks is deliberately NOT cleared here any more. "A wake-up was
# scheduled" and "this agent has been repeatedly trying to end its turn" are
# independent facts, and clearing the counter on marker consumption let a single
# backgrounded command both permit the stop AND erase the evidence of the
# pattern.

  #
  # A marker without that (what mark-wakeup.sh writes on any Task/Agent dispatch
  # or backgrounded Bash call) records only that something was DISPATCHED. A
  # dispatch is not a promise to come back: a subagent that runs forever, or a
  # background command with no timeout, satisfies it and then never returns, and

BLOCKED (butler continuity-gate)
: this turn is ending with nothing scheduled
to resume this armed session, and it has not been disarmed.

This session was explicitly armed to be watched. A turn may end only if
something will wake it, or the arm is explicitly lifted. Neither holds now.

Do one of these NOW, in this turn:
  * take a BOUNDED wait -- run this as a BACKGROUND Bash call, so its exit
    re-invokes this session at a time known in advance:

      perl $CONT_PL hold --seconds 600

    Dispatching a subagent or backgrounding a command is NOT enough on its own.
    A dispatch is not a promise to come back: if it never returns, nothing is
    left to wake this session. Take the hold alongside whatever you dispatched,
    then poll it when the hold elapses and hold again if you are still waiting.

  * explicitly disarm: perl plugins/butler/scripts/bp-continuity.pl disarm
    (or /butler:continuity off) if the watched work is actually finished, or
  * touch $MARK.stop-ok to skip just this once.

(This will not block more than $MAX_BLOCKS times in a row.)
