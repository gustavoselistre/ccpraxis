description: Execute a blueprint as a headless multi-coordinator FLEET (sandbox-only) — start the deterministic, token-free orchestrator script that watches, launches, relaunches, governs usage, keeps the OAuth token alive, and auto-resumes, then hand off to /butler:reporter to observe and answer decisions. Use when the user wants to run, start, kick off, dispatch, or continue a blueprint unattended at scale, or after /blueprint:create when execution should begin. Idempotent start-or-continue (no separate resume). The host-safe single-session alternative is /butler:drive-solo.

# /butler:dispatch-fleet

Start (or continue) the **headless fleet** for a blueprint. First read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/orchestrator-protocol/SKILL.md` — the **Cast** and **Dispatch a fleet** sections are binding.

The model: a **deterministic, token-free orchestrator script** (`bp-orchestrator.pl`) does ALL of the driving — it watches coordinators, launches newly-ready packages off the DAG, relaunches crashed/wedged ones, polls usage and pauses *below* the ceiling, keeps the OAuth token alive, and auto-resumes after a reset. **You do not run a monitoring loop**; there is no "you are the orchestrator" session anymore. Your job here is just to *start* it and hand the user to the reporter.

Sandbox-only: the fleet is detached `claude -p` coordinators (`setsid`/`nohup`/`flock`), which only work inside the rootless-Podman sandbox. `bp-orchestrate.sh` refuses on the host.

> **One-time login required:** log in once interactively (`claude-sandbox` → `/login`) before the first fleet. The preflight checks for a usable sandbox login and refuses without one; thereafter fleets ride the persisted independent token (the keeper refreshes it).

## Steps

1. **Prerequisite — a blueprint exists, audited, with real ledgers.** Confirm `<data>/blueprints/$0/blueprint.md` plus `packages/<pkg>.md` ledgers exist with non-empty `write_set` frontmatter. If it is missing, unaudited, or has empty write sets, stop and send the user to `/blueprint:create` (or `/blueprint:manage audit`) — never launch an unscoped fleet.

2. **Start (or continue) the orchestrator:**
   ```
   bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/bp-orchestrate.sh" $0
   ```
   It is **idempotent start-or-continue**: it refuses on the host, detaches the deterministic orchestrator, and — if one is already live (its `runs/.orchestrator` marker PID is alive) — just reports that and exits. The orchestrator's own resume-sweep folds in warm/cold recovery of any interrupted coordinators, so there is **no separate resume verb**. If a prior run was torn down by a graceful-reap (e.g. the host slept and the container reaped it), a terminal `runs/.shutdown` marker can linger; since no live orchestrator holds the marker, dispatch treats it as stale and clears it on start so the fleet actually resumes instead of winding straight back down.

3. **Record the launch** in `blueprint.md`: set `status: running`, and refresh `last_updated` with `iso_now` (or `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`) — do not write it from memory; you have no clock. (The per-package status rows are now maintained by the orchestrator + harvest-judge; you set the blueprint-level fields.)

4. **Hand off to the reporter.** Tell the user the fleet is running **unattended** and that they observe progress and answer queued decisions via:
   ```
   /butler:reporter $0
   ```
   Closing this session does **not** stop the run — the orchestrator is detached and survives on the container's dashboard heartbeat. Recovery after a container restart is automatic on the next `bp-orchestrate.sh` (it continues, never duplicates).

<!-- continuity:begin -->
Fleet coordinators wait on background subagents through `butler-hold` and stop only on a
terminal ledger. This session is not armed by dispatch-fleet, so watching happens in
`/butler:reporter`, which arms itself.
<!-- continuity:end -->

> **Not this verb?** For a single interactive session with a flat worker layer (host-safe, no detached coordinators), use `/butler:drive-solo $0` — the **linear single-session, host-or-sandbox counterpart** that drives one/some/all blueprints as a thin loop over the perl director (shares building blocks like usage-governance and the per-package pipeline; different functionality — Decision #10). To just check state without touching anything, `/butler:status`.
