package BpState;
# BpState.pm — pure reader of the two authoritative status stores: package
# ledger frontmatter ('packages/<pkg>.md''s 'status:' line) and the
# orchestrator run marker ('runs/.orchestrator') — spec
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/butler-and-dashboard-overhaul/specs/
# s01-status-read-api-spec.md.
#
# Pure and total with respect to BpState's OWN code and its own inputs
# (paths, file contents, including undef): never raises a fatal exception on
# any such input, no clock (time/gmtime/localtime), no invoking other
# processes or executables, no replacing or branching this process, no
# signalling another process — process liveness is delegated entirely to a
# caller-injected $alive_fn coderef (mandatory for
# run_is_live/blueprint_lifecycle; BpState never supplies a default prober,
# which would reintroduce a signal-0 probe and its known false-negative on
# native Windows processes). Every function returns its declared type for
# every input; nothing under $bpdir is ever written.
#
# ONE DELIBERATE EXCEPTION to totality, found in the s01 fix-batch step-7
# red-team (M3): if the caller-supplied $alive_fn itself dies when called,
# that exception propagates out of run_is_live/blueprint_lifecycle
# uncaught. This is BY DESIGN, not an oversight -- do not wrap the call in
# eval to "complete" totality. Catching it would force some verdict, and
# for run_is_live the only sane fallback verdict is "not live" (0), which is
# the SETTLED direction Decision 6 forbids resolving uncertainty toward: a
# caller whose liveness probe is broken should see that loudly, not have
# BpState quietly launder it into a false "the run is dead." BpState cannot
# know why $alive_fn died, so guessing "dead" is the dangerous guess, not
# the safe one. Totality is a promise about BpState's own logic; a
# caller-supplied coderef that misbehaves is the caller's failure to
# surface, not BpState's to hide.
#
# opendir/readdir only, never glob — glob splits its argument on whitespace
# and silently drops fragments for paths containing spaces, a real landmine
# on this machine. This module never assumes an ASCII path.
#
# Nothing is exported; callers use fully-qualified names
# (BpState::package_status(...), etc.), mirroring RunState.pm's convention
# (plugins/sandbox/scripts/RunState.pm:1-37).
#
# fm_get, marker_pid, bp_meta_get and norm_bp_status below are lifted
# verbatim from bp-lifecycle.pl (see spec §1.2 for exact line citations).
# norm_pkg_status is the one deliberate variant of bp-lifecycle.pl's
# norm_status: the whitelist gains 'converging', a real mid-flight ledger
# value bp-lifecycle.pl's own vocabulary does not need but BpState's callers
# (s02-s04) do, per the spec §1/§2.1 driver ruling.

# VARIANT of bp-lifecycle.pl's norm_status (bp-lifecycle.pl:171-181): the
# whitelist gains 'converging'. Same decoration-stripping/lowercase steps.
#
# DELIBERATE FORK from bp-lifecycle.pl:177-179's norm_status, found and fixed
# in this package's fix-batch step 7 (s01 red-team M1): the original scans
# split(/\s+/) word-by-word and returns the FIRST word that matches a known
# status, so a NEGATED or compound value word-scans past its own negation --
# 'not-done' normalises to the words ('not','done') and the loop returns
# 'done'; 'not-archived-yet' returns 'archived'. That resolves an unknown or
# explicitly-negated value toward a SETTLED status, which is exactly what
# this blueprint's Decision 6 forbids ("uncertainty resolves toward LIVE,
# never toward settled") -- earned the hard way by shipping the inverse bug
# three times in one session. bp-lifecycle.pl's copy still has this bug;
# it is intentionally NOT fixed here (out of this write set, Decision 15;
# the driver is handling bp-lifecycle.pl separately). s02-s04: do NOT
# "restore parity" with bp-lifecycle.pl's norm_status by reverting this to a
# word-scan -- that would reintroduce the bug BpState was forked to avoid.
#
# The fix: match the WHOLE normalised (decoration-stripped, lowercased,
# trimmed) value against the whitelist, not its first word. A multi-word or
# negated value (e.g. 'not done', 'not-archived-yet' -> 'not archived yet')
# therefore never equals a single whitelist word and correctly falls through
# to '' (which package_status then collapses to the non-terminal 'pending'
# per spec §2.2), instead of being misread as the terminal word it merely
# contains. A genuinely single-word decorated value (e.g. '✅ done') still
# normalises to exactly 'done' and matches as before.

# One of drafting|audited|running|done|archived. Precedence, first match
# wins (spec §2.4, a design decision assembled from reconcile_one's prose
# logic, not verbatim source):
#   1. a live run beats every authored value, including archived.
#   2. authored 'archived' beats the delivered computation (never
#      re-derived to done).
#   3. all-delivered (>=1 package, every value in {done,dropped}) derives
#      'done' for any authored value that is already at or past 'done' in
#      the sense of "the work described by this word is finished":
#      {audited,running,done}. This is the ADVANCE gate; there used to be a
#      %ADVANCEABLE table in bp-lifecycle.pl mirroring it, this package
#      deleted that table, so the gate is now just these three literal
#      words, spelled out at the call site below. (Authored 'done' with
#      all packages delivered is a no-op pass through this gate -- it was
#      already 'done' -- but it MUST be listed here, not left to fall
#      through to step 4, or it is silently demoted; see the inline
#      comment below, F1.)
#   4. authored 'drafting' -> drafting; authored 'audited' -> audited;
#      authored 'running' -> running: each of the three NON-done authored
#      words keeps itself when step 3 did not fire (drafting never
#      advances on its own; audited/running only advance under step 3).
#      Deliberately NOT extended to 'done' here: an authored 'done' that
#      is NOT all-delivered has no branch of its own and falls through to
#      step 5's default -- this is pre-existing, protected behavior
#      (t/lifecycle-derived.t AC7 "ac7-stale-done": an old-shape 'done' with an undelivered
#      package derives to 'drafting', never trusted literally), not
#      something this package's fix touches.
#   5. final default 'drafting' — blueprint.md absent/unreadable, authored
#      '', authored 'done' without all-delivered (step 4's note above), or
#      anything norm_bp_status did not recognise is treated as ABSENT per
