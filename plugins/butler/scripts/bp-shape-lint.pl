# bp-shape-lint.pl — flag oracle assertions that pin the WHOLE SHAPE of a
# shared artifact, rather than the package's own contribution.
#
# WHY
#
# Six times in one blueprint an assertion froze a total over something other
# packages must be able to extend, and each time a later package doing exactly
# what it was mandated to do turned a done sibling red:
#
#   * t/25  pinned coordinator-protocol/SKILL.md at exactly 12 '## ' headings,
#           forcing b14 and b20 to demote their sections to '###'.
#   * FOUR oracles pinned launcher.pl's literal 10-second poll cadence, which
#           s17 was REQUIRED to replace with a named constant.
#   * t/56  froze container/settings.json's entire key set, which s17 was
#           REQUIRED to add a key to.
#   * t/87  pinned "exactly 57 ledgers cite a SYN- decision" — which broke on
#           ordinary ledger prose citing SYN-21, having already been corrected
#           once from 32.
#
# The standing rule is: assert YOUR package's contribution, never the whole
# tree's shape, because the latter forbids every later package from extending
# it. t/64's AC-36 shows the fix — `cmp_ok(scalar(@$pre), '>=', 4)` with a
# comment recording the old `is(..., 4)`.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT
#
# Not a correctness checker, and deliberately not silent-clean. Per-fixture
# counts on locally-built data ("exactly one relaunch", "exactly one escalations
# file") are correct and must NOT be flagged; the whole skill is telling those
# apart from corpus pins. So this reports CANDIDATES with the evidence that
# made each suspicious, and a human decides. It fails loudly rather than
# pretending precision it does not have.
#
# Usage:
#   bp-shape-lint.pl <test-file-or-dir>...
# Exit: 0 = no candidates, 1 = candidates found (report on stdout), 2 = usage.

        # (d) STRUCTURAL, and deliberately NOUN-INDEPENDENT: a count pinned over
        #     a DEREFERENCED container -- `scalar(keys %$table)`, `scalar(@$rows)`.
        #
        #     Rules (a) and (b) both gate on $SHARED, a whitelist of nouns, and
        #     that whitelist is precisely what missed the EIGHTH instance:
        #     t/39 pinned `glyph_table()` at exactly 18 entries, and $SHARED
        #     carries `glyph\s*table` -- which does NOT match `glyph_table`,
        #     because `\s*` does not match an underscore. A one-character gap in
        #     a prose heuristic let a global pin through.
        #
        #     So this rule asks a STRUCTURAL question instead of a linguistic
        #     one: you are counting something you had to DEREFERENCE, which means
        #     it came from somewhere else -- a function return or shared state --
        #     rather than a fixture you built in this file. That is the shape of
        #     a global pin regardless of what the description calls it.
        #
        #     $LOCAL still suppresses (a fixture self-check is legitimate), and
        #     the `# shape-lint: intentional — <reason>` marker still applies, as
        #     t/00 filters marked lines out of these hits.
        #     NARROWED TO KEY SETS, and the narrowing was measured rather than
        #     guessed. Matching `@$rows` as well produced 21 candidates across
        #     the two suites, nearly all of them legitimate -- "compose: exactly
        #     $rows rows" counts a frame the test itself built, which is a
        #     package asserting its own behaviour. A lint at that noise level is
        #     one nobody runs, which is how the earlier 47-candidate draft died.
        #
        #     A KEY SET is different in kind, and it is the doctrine's own
        #     example: the keys of a returned structure are its SHAPE, and
        #     pinning them forbids every later package from extending it. Row
        #     counts are behaviour; key counts are shape.
