# bp-ledger.pl — the deterministic ledger API (b13-deterministic-ledger-api).
#
# Five typed, surgical mutation ops on a package ledger (set-status, append-attempt,
# tick-step, set-next-action, add-output) plus a `validate` subcommand that runs the
# same V1-V5 byte-oriented rule set ledger-guard.sh (b12) enforces. See:
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-butler-overhaul/specs/b13-deterministic-ledger-api-spec.md
#
# Plus a sixth op, `rotate` (b45-ledger-context-budget), which moves stale
# `## Decisions & attempt log` entries out to reports/ledger-history/<pkg>.md so the
# ledger stays inside a context budget. See:
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-butler-overhaul/specs/b45-ledger-context-budget-spec.md
#
# Exit codes (an interface, fixed): 0 success, 2 validation rejection (byte-identical
# file), 3 usage/argument error (nothing read), 4 I/O/lock/atomicity failure
# (byte-identical), 5 target region not found (byte-identical).
#
# stdout is ALWAYS empty, EXCEPT `rotate --dry-run`, which is a report-only op by
# spec (b45 §3) and prints its report to stdout while touching nothing. stderr on any
# non-zero exit is EXACTLY ONE line. `append-attempt` may ALSO print one budget-notice
# line to stderr on an otherwise-successful (exit 0) run — see DEFAULT_BUDGET_BYTES
# below; that is not a rejection, just visibility, and the append still happens.
# `rotate` may likewise print one LEDGER_IRREDUCIBLE notice to stderr on an otherwise-
# successful (exit 0) run when it determines the ledger cannot be reduced further
# (a03-ledger-budget-irreducible spec §2.1/§2.5) — same non-error notice shape, same
# one-line discipline.
