#!/usr/bin/env perl
# bp-watch.pl — the general, condition-driven watcher for both interactive
# surfaces (/butler:reporter, /butler:drive-solo), armed ALONGSIDE each
# surface's existing mechanism, never replacing it.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# Neither interactive surface can tell a healthy run from a dead one.
# Reporter blocks only on bp-wait-for-decision.pl, which wakes on a QUEUED
# decision -- the orchestrator dying, the container being reaped, a clean
# idle-exit with everything done, or a single package flipping to done never
# queue one, so none of them was ever noticed ({"status":"timeout"} returned
# twice against a dead orchestrator and zero coordinators, and would have
# forever). Drive-solo's bp-watchdog.pl is a single 30-minute timer whose
# progress scan walks the WHOLE blueprints tree with no subject-scoping
# argument at all, so a driver's own ledger edit reads as the worker's
# progress -- it reported VERDICT: PROGRESS three times during a real
# four-hour stall. bp-watch.pl closes both gaps: it exits on a named
# CONDITION (seconds, not up to thirty minutes), it is subject-scoped, and
# one arm covers a whole dispatch (--max-seconds sized to it, required, no
# default) instead of a universal timer requiring dozens of forgettable
# re-arms across one long run (2026-08-06 #11).
#
# THE FOUR INVARIANTS. Each was earned by a real shipped bug, and each is
# enforced here structurally, not by comment:
#
#   1. is_terminal_status() allowlists the TERMINAL set only
#      (done|dropped|blocked|parked). A first version allowlisted the LIVE
#      set instead, so free-text `converging` a coordinator actually wrote
#      into its frontmatter read as settled.
#   2. read_packages_dir() reads packages/*.md, NEVER runs/registry.json --
#      the registry only knows LAUNCHED packages. With 2 of 5 launched,
#      "all registry entries terminal" was reachable with three never run.
#   3. Liveness is PID-scoped via BpRunState::pid_alive (bp-runstate.pl,
#      kill(0)-then-tasklist), reused rather than reinvented. The shipped bug
#      was `ps -eo args | grep -c '[c]laude'`, which matched every bash
#      tool-call process through the shell-snapshot path -- the headline
#      death-detection feature could NEVER have fired.
#   4. artifact_snapshot()/artifact_changed() are scoped to the caller's
#      explicit @paths only, never a tree-wide mtime walk -- bp-watchdog.pl's
#      LIVE defect (snapshot(), bp-watchdog.pl:102-136), which let a driver's
#      own ledger writes manufacture false PROGRESS verdicts during a real
#      stall. bp-watchdog.pl is SUPERSEDED by this file for that role (see
#      its own header), not fixed in place.
#
# THE UMBRELLA RULE, stated once and inherited by all four: a watcher's
# errors must never resolve toward "finished"; uncertainty resolves to LIVE.
# resolve_condition() is where this is enforced in code: every axis that
# cannot positively confirm its condition (undef status, undef pids_alive
# because no PID axis is configured, artifact_changed false) is treated as
# absent evidence, never as a synonym for "confirmed" -- in particular,
# pids_alive => undef must never misread as pids_alive => 0 via bare Perl
# truthiness, which is exactly the trap the `defined` checks below exist to
# avoid.
#
# SHAPE. Mirrors bp-wait-for-decision.pl / bp-runstate.pl: a `package
# BpWatch;` block of pure, injectable-seam functions, `require`-able with
# zero real sleeping/filesystem writes to exercise the decision logic, and a
# `package main;` CLI behind `unless (caller)`.
#
# EXIT CODES ARE THE SIGNAL (unlike bp-watchdog.pl's always-0 convention) --
# a gate-drive-loop.sh-style consumer needs a cheap $?:
#   0  TERMINAL/SETTLED   subject (or whole blueprint, Mode B) reached the
#                         invariant-1 allowlist. Does not imply "never re-arm".
#   1  BOUND              --max-seconds elapsed, nothing resolved. Liveness
#                         is UNKNOWN -- never treat as dead or done.
#   2  WORKERS-GONE       any ONE configured pid confirmed dead, no terminal
#                         status observed. Likely crash; investigate.
#   3  ARTIFACT           a watched path's mtime advanced, or it appeared.
#   4  STATUS-CHANGE      ledger status changed to a NON-terminal value (a
#                         terminal value takes exit 0 instead).
#   64 USAGE ERROR
#   65 UNVERIFIABLE       data dir / blueprint / package not found, or a
#                         check itself failed. MUST be read as LIVE, never 0.
#
# --max-seconds is REQUIRED, no default -- bp-watchdog.pl's universal 1800s
# default is exactly the habit that produced dozens of forgettable 30-minute
# re-arms across one long dispatch. Sizing the bound to the actual dispatch
# is deliberate friction, not an oversight.
#
# --pid-file is RE-READ ON EVERY POLL TICK, never cached at arm time, so a
# marker that disappears (clean exit) or is replaced (a new orchestrator, a
# different pid) is picked up live.
#
# --keepawake (drive-solo only, opt-in) refreshes the EXISTING
# bp-keepawake.pl lease (the same .drive-solo/keepawake.pid bp-drive-next.pl
# already manages) once per poll tick -- it does not create a second lock.
# Closes the gap where that lease (900s) is refreshed only when the director
# runs, and the director is skipped whenever a wakeup is already pending, so
# a long watch window can outlive its own lease.

    #
    # WHY THIS EXISTS. Before it did, the only documented path to satisfy the
    # stop-gate around a dispatch was three manual steps: background this
    # script, `ps`-grep its own pid back out, then call `bp-runstate.pl pause
    # --watcher-pid <that pid>` separately. That friction is exactly what
    # produced a real incident: a driver session, instead of doing that
    # dance, wrote its own throwaway `sleep`-loop watcher sized by guesswork
    # (5 minutes, with no relation to anything) rather than to this script's
    # own `--max-seconds`, and re-armed it many more times than the actual
    # work required -- BpRunState::pause's own header already names this
    # exact shape ("a backgrounded sleep loop armed solely to satisfy the
    # gate") as a known failure mode. `--self-pause` collapses the dance to
    # one flag: the watcher IS the pause, so there is nothing left to invent.
    #
    # `until` is `now + max_seconds` UNCLAMPED here -- BpRunState::pause
    # applies its own 50-minute cap regardless of what is asked, so this
    # deliberately does not duplicate that constant or that decision; a
    # `--max-seconds` under an hour (the common case) passes through exactly,
    # and a longer one is clamped by the one place that owns the cap.
