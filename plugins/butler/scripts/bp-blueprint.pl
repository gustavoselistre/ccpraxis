# bp-blueprint.pl — the deterministic blueprint.md write/read API (b43-blueprint-write-api).
#
# Typed, surgical write ops (add-package, set-deps, add-decision,
# set-decision, set-field, add-harvest, set-meta, set-section, set-test-paths, init) plus
# four read ops (show, deps, status, decisions) over the
# package-status table `bp-orchestrator.pl`'s BpOrch::parse_dag reads. `set-status` is
# retired (Decision 11/s03: the table has no `status` column any more) -- it still
# dispatches, but only to refuse loudly; `set-field --field status` refuses the same way.
# `ready` was a read op and no longer exists. See:
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-butler-overhaul/specs/b43-blueprint-write-api-spec.md
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: every hand-splice of blueprint.md to date has been correct by luck,
# never by construction (spec preamble). This API makes "correct by construction" the
# only path: atomic temp+rename under flock, refuse-rather-than-guess validation, and
# the SAME parser (BpOrch::parse_dag) the orchestrator reads with -- never a second,
# drifting implementation (spec §2.3, the b12/b13 lesson).
#
# :raw ONLY, throughout. NEVER add an :encoding(UTF-8) layer -- the file carries
# Andr\x{e9}-class paths and multi-byte status glyphs as raw bytes; decoding them and
# re-encoding on write would corrupt the byte-identical round trip (spec G11 / landmine 2).
#
# Exit codes (not part of the oracle's contract, but kept consistent with bp-ledger.pl's
# shape): 0 success, 2 validation refusal (byte-identical file), 3 usage/argument error
# (nothing read), 4 I/O/lock/atomicity failure (byte-identical), 5 target not found.
#
# Core Perl only: strict, warnings, Getopt::Long, Fcntl(:flock), File::Basename. The two
# REAL parsers/validators (BpOrch::parse_dag / BpOrch::resolve_dep_token, both living in
# bp-orchestrator.pl) are `require`d, never reimplemented (spec §2.3).

# op_init — CREATE blueprint.md from a template.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `guard-blueprint-write.sh` denies Write/Edit to ANY blueprint.md
# path -- including one that does not exist yet -- while /blueprint:create step 4 said
# "Write blueprint.md from templates/blueprint.md". The documented create flow was
# therefore impossible to execute as written, and every author had to route around the
# guard via Bash: exactly the hand-splice the guard exists to prevent, through a door
# the hook cannot see. Prose said one thing, the mechanism enforced another.
#
# The template path is a PARAMETER, never derived here. bp-blueprint.pl ships in the
# butler plugin; the template ships in the blueprint plugin, and installed plugins live
# in separate cache trees -- so a cross-plugin path would resolve on a dev checkout and
# break on a real install. The caller (which owns the template) passes it in.

# op_set_title — rewrite the document's H1 title (line 1: `# <text>`).
#
# No existing verb owns this region (04-blueprint-title-verb spec §1): `set-meta` only
# rewrites `key: value` lines inside the fenced metadata block, and `set-section`
# explicitly refuses structural sections and operates on `##` headings, not the H1.
# Fence-aware (spec §2.2): both real blueprints carry single-`#`-prefixed COMMENT lines
# (e.g. `# worker_backend: claude`) inside the fenced metadata block, which a naive `^#`
# scan would miscount as extra H1 candidates and refuse on every real invocation.
# Refuse-rather-than-guess on no H1 / H1 not on line 1 / more than one candidate --
# matching this script's existing posture (add-package refuses a missing depends_on
# table rather than inventing one; set-section refuses a missing `## ` heading the same
# way). Always normalises to a single space after `#` (spec §2.3), so idempotence falls
# out of run_write's own `$new eq $orig` no-op branch -- no second check is added here.
