# bp-judge.sh — fire ONE scoped, throwaway judge for a package and detach it.
#
# Usage:
#   bp-judge.sh <harvest|resolve> <blueprint> <package> <verdict_path>
#
# Called by the deterministic orchestrator (bp-orchestrator.pl's spawn_judge seam),
# never by hand. The judge is a fresh headless `claude -p` that reads its scoped
# slice, writes a verdict JSON to <verdict_path>, and exits — the orchestrator polls
# for that file (it never blocks its watch tick on the judge).
#
# Hook scoping: judges export the same BP_* env contract as coordinators so
# guard-writes.sh contains their writes — but with BP_ROLE != coordinator, so
# stop-gate.sh / track-dispatch.sh skip them (a judge is one-shot; coordinator
# stop-discipline would wedge it). The harvest judge gets an EMPTY write_set
# (read-only: only its verdict, which lands under BP_DIR, is writable); the resolve
# judge gets the package's real write_set so its fix is contained.
#
# b11-progress-heuristic-turns-backstop: when bp-progress.pl's semantic tail-read
# (bp-orchestrator.pl's watchdog, gated on BP_PROGRESS_MODEL_CMD) returns a confident
# `looping`/`stuck` verdict, the orchestrator kills that coordinator and escalates it
# through the SAME `resolve` path this script already serves (_escalate_stuck ->
# spawn_judge kind=resolve) — no new judge kind, no change here. `bp-progress.pl`'s
# OWN `capped` condition (the turn cap reached before the heuristic got a confident
# read) is a distinct, guard-level log line in runs/orchestrator.log; it never queues
# a resolve judge and never touches this script's inputs.

Read your agent contract at $AGENT_FILE and follow it exactly.

You are the INITIATIVE-scoped conformance judge for blueprint '$BP_NAME'.
Blueprint file: $BLUEPRINT_FILE
Package ledgers: $BPDIR/packages/
Dependency report (may be absent; read-only): $BPDIR/runs/deps-check.json
Write your verdict JSON to exactly this path and nothing else: $VERDICT_PATH

Scope: read the blueprint's Objective + Decisions and EVERY package ledger's
explicit \`mandated_means:\` list, then verify against the delivered code on disk
that each listed means is genuinely used — present and wired, not a hand-rolled
substitute. Check methodology claims too (e.g. a real emulator where one was
mandated, not a forbidden mock).

Rules:
- Judge the EXPLICIT \`mandated_means:\` list only. Prose in a ledger is NOT a
  source of mandated means.
- For each deviation you find, report {package, means, observed, files[]}. Do NOT
  decide whether it is justified — the orchestrator reads the ledger's
  MEANS-DEVIATION marker and classifies it deterministically.
- Do NOT write review or notice files; the orchestrator writes those.
- Disk is truth; a coordinator's say-so is not. When in doubt, fail with a precise
  reason: a false pass ships broken work, a false fail costs one cheap re-check.
