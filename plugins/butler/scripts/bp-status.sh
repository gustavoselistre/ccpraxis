# liveness + the first line of "Next action". It never reads stream logs.
# A directory under blueprints/ with no blueprint.md is a stray, never removed,
# and is reported in a trailing "!!"-prefixed section; a named-arg lookup that
# resolves to a stray or to nothing fails loudly (exit 3) instead of listing.

# the thing that could not run. Degrade instead: without jq the two registry
# columns read "?" and everything sourced from the ledgers still prints.

# Reconcile before reporting. As of s05-retire-reconciler-drift-paths
# (2026-08-14), this repairs only two things on observation: a stale
# runs/.orchestrator marker, and a terminal package's leftover registry pid
# (see the header of bp-lifecycle.pl). blueprint.md's package-status table
# and runs/registry.json's `status` field are NOT repaired here any more —
# their writer/readers were retired, so there is nothing left to reconcile
# for either.
#
# --no-archive: filing a finished blueprint away is a decision for the verbs
# that own the lifecycle (/blueprint:manage, the drive loop), not a side effect
# of asking for status. A `status` that silently moved directories would be a
# nasty surprise, and it would race a fleet that is about to be relaunched.
# Failure here is never fatal — a status read must still work if reconciliation
# cannot.
