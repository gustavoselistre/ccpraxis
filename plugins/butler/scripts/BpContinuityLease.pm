package BpContinuityLease;
# BpContinuityLease — hold the machine/container awake for as long as a session
# is ARMED FOR CONTINUITY, and release it when it is turned off.
#
# THE HOLE THIS FILLS.
#
# Every other long-running butler driver holds a wake-lock: bp-drive-next.pl and
# bp-orchestrator.pl both call BpKeepAwake::apply, and the fleet orchestrator
# also refreshes the busy-lease (/tmp/.butler-busy) that keeps a sandbox
# container from reaping itself and — through launcher.pl's dashboard probe —
# keeps the HOST awake behind it.
#
# `/butler:continuity on` held NEITHER. That is the exact inversion of
# bp-keepawake.pl's own founding complaint ("the lock existed on the path that
# needs it least and was absent from the one that needs it most"), one level
# further out: continuity arming exists PRECISELY for unattended work with no
# blueprint, no drive-solo and no reporter — i.e. for the sessions where nothing
# else is holding a lock, and nobody is sitting there to notice the host drop
# into connected standby or the container reap itself out from under the run.
#
# NAMING (Decision 10, resolved by package 04's spec 1.3): this module is BOTH
# the Windows HOST REFRESHER (daemon_loop starts and refreshes keep-awake.ps1)
# and the container's busy-lease toucher. Decision 10's "sandbox-side lease"
# was right about the objects -- the busy-lease and the keep-awake PidFile
# lease are independent -- but wrong to call the module itself sandbox-side.
# Packages 04-06 mean this module's Windows branch when they say "the
# refresher": the host refresher.
#
# TWO SURFACES, ONE PER PLATFORM — and they are not alternatives.
#
#   Windows host      -> the wake-lock (BpKeepAwake -> keep-awake.ps1). There is
#                        no container to keep alive; the risk is S0 standby.
#   Linux (a sandbox) -> the busy-lease (/tmp/.butler-busy). There is no
#                        SetThreadExecutionState to call, and the risk is
#                        heartbeat.sh reaping the container. Touching the lease
#                        ALSO keeps the host awake, because launcher.pl's
#                        dashboard gates its own keep-awake on this very file's
#                        freshness (KeepAwake::should_stay_awake, BUSY_STALE 600s).
#
# So the same arm covers both worlds, and in the sandbox case it covers both
# ENDS of it — which is what "must work inside a sandbox and outside on the
# host" actually requires.
#
# There is a THIRD case, and it holds nothing: a Linux or macOS HOST. No
# SetThreadExecutionState, and no heartbeat.sh or dashboard reading
# /tmp/.butler-busy — so writing that file there would be a lease in name only,
# and state() would then report "held" off the file it had just created. That is
# the one thing bp-keepawake.pl's header forbids outright, so platform() names
# the case 'unsupported' and every branch returns honestly instead.
#
# HELD UNTIL TURNED OFF, not until the next lease expiry.
#
# Both mechanisms are deliberately LEASED rather than held-until-killed (see
# keep-awake.ps1's header for what an unleased orphan cost: ES_DISPLAY_REQUIRED
# held until reboot). A lease needs a refresher, and the refresher cannot be
# "whatever the agent happens to run next": a single turn can outlast the lease
# with no Stop hook and no `hold` tick in between, which is exactly the long
# unattended turn the lock exists to protect.
#
# So arming starts a detached refresher process (this module's own `lease
# --daemon` CLI entry) whose ONLY job is to re-assert both leases every tick for as long
# as any session is armed, and to release and exit once none is. Disarm does not
# have to kill it — it notices within a tick — but disarm re-syncs anyway so the
# release is immediate.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE PROCESS AND NOT A FORKED CHILD. On Git-for-Windows perl fork()
# is emulated with THREADS inside the same process, so a forked child dies the
# moment the parent perl exits — and the parent here is a one-shot Bash tool
# call. exec() from the pseudo-process starts a real, independent process that
# outlives it, which is the same mechanism keep-awake.ps1 already relies on.
# Verified end-to-end on this host: after `arm` returned, the daemon was still
# ticking and had brought the wake-lock up behind it.
#
# WHAT BOUNDS AN ABANDONED ARM. A session that dies without disarming leaves a
# marker behind, and the lease follows the marker: the refresher holds until
# nothing is armed, and the marker stops counting at the continuity TTL (12h by
# default, CCPRAXIS_CONTINUITY_TTL_H). So the worst case is a display held on for
# as long as the arm itself is still considered valid — and stop-gate.sh
# usually reaps such a marker much sooner, on the next Stop of ANY session.
#
# That horizon is deliberate rather than merely inherited. A shorter one just
# for the lease would mean a session can be "armed but no longer protected",
# which is precisely the state this file exists to remove; the arm and the thing
# that keeps the arm workable expire together.
#
# ITS PID IS STILL NOT A LIVENESS TEST, THOUGH. MSYS perl's $$ is an MSYS pid,
# not a Windows one — measured: a live daemon recorded 16818 and tasklist knew
# no such task. So identity here is the pid FILE (a heartbeat, for cheap
# readers) plus an flock (for exclusion), and the recorded number is only ever
# something for a human to act on. See ensure_daemon and daemon_loop.

#
# ONLY THE REFRESHER CALLS THIS WITH active => 1. Non-daemon callers go through
# converge() instead, which refreshes and delegates starting to the daemon. One
# process may start the wake-lock helper; everything else only ever re-asserts
# or releases. Measured 2026-09-15, before that rule existed: three `arm`s in
# the same instant plus a refresher left FIFTEEN live keep-awake.ps1 helpers and
# a pid file that survived disarm, because each caller independently decided the
# lock was missing while a helper was still starting. BpKeepAwake::apply now
# claims the pid file atomically, which closes the same race one level down —
# both are needed: the claim makes a double start impossible, and this rule
# means it is not attempted in the first place.
#
# NOTE WHAT RELEASE DOES **NOT** DO: it never unlinks the busy-lease. That file
# is SHARED with bp-orchestrator.pl, so deleting it on disarm would cancel a
# live fleet run's own lease and invite heartbeat.sh to reap the container out
# from under it. Letting it go stale is the orchestrator's own contract for

    # ensure_daemon's heartbeat check is a cheap filter, and it has a real race:
    # two arms in the same second both find no pid file and both spawn. A check
    # inside the daemon closes nothing on its own, because both daemons can run
    # it before either writes. An advisory lock held for the process's lifetime
    # is the only version of this that is actually exclusive — and the OS drops
    # it when the holder dies, so a crashed daemon leaves nothing to clean up.
    #
    # A separate file from the pid/heartbeat on purpose: the heartbeat's whole
    # job is to be rewritten and re-stat'd constantly, which is the last thing
    # you want under a lock others are testing.
    #
    # IT IS NEVER UNLINKED, and that is the right call rather than an oversight.
    # Removing it would race: on POSIX an unlink succeeds while another process
    # holds the lock on the same inode, so the next arrival creates a FRESH file,
    # locks that instead, and both refreshers then believe they are the only one.
    # The residue is one empty dot-named file per registry, which any_active
    # already ignores.
    # DEGRADES TO UNLOCKED RATHER THAN TO NOTHING. If the lock file cannot be
    # opened at all — an unwritable registry, a full disk, a mount where this
    # fails — returning early would leave the arm with NO refresher, and
    # ensure_daemon would start a fresh one that failed the same way on every
    # Stop, forever, silently. Running without exclusivity risks a second
    # refresher; running not at all risks a suspended host mid-run. The first is
    # the lesser failure, and BpKeepAwake's atomic claim still stops two
    # refreshers from becoming two wake-locks.
