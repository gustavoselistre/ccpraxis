# bp-lib.sh — butler's copy of the shared base helpers PLUS sandbox-only execution helpers.
# Sourced by scripts/ and hooks/. Must stay dependency-light: bash, coreutils, jq, flock.
#
# SUBSET/SUPERSET RELATIONSHIP: The 7 shared base helpers (bp_project_root,
# bp_data_dir, bp_dir, bp_ledger, fm_get, iso_now, file_age_min) at the top of
# this file are kept byte-identical with the counterpart at
# plugins/blueprint/scripts/bp-lib.sh (the host-safe authoring subset). Butler
# adds sandbox-only execution helpers on top (pid_alive, match_any, registry_*,
# count_running_global, require_cmd, bp_require_sandbox) that must NOT be copied
# to the blueprint side (host lacks jq/flock; authoring must stay host-safe).

#
# 2026-08-19 d03-one-shell-noise-stripper (almanac report 20260814-093113-34a0):
# arm-on-entry.sh's own inline copy is GONE. This sentence used to claim it was
# "deliberately left as-is rather than refactored to call this" because "only
# a genuinely NEW caller needs to reuse rather than reinvent" -- that claim is
# now FALSE and would contradict the code next to it if left standing. Both of
# arm-on-entry.sh's arms (the reporter-arm block and the driver-arm block) now
# call this function via a conditional source of this file, mirroring
# guard-bash.sh:70-74. This is the third and last treatment of
# one problem collapsing to one implementation, not two independent copies
# plus a shared one.
#
# NOT a shell parser: VARIABLE EXPANSION is not resolved, so an invocation
# built through string concatenation or a variable (e.g. `X="bp-drive-next.pl
# next"; eval "$X"`) still slips past filtering -- an accepted, documented
# residual, same direction every caller of this helper already accepts for
# its own analogous gap. This residual is about text that DOES NOT LITERALLY
# APPEAR in the command -- it is constructed at runtime. It does NOT excuse
# $(...), backticks, or <(...): those are ordinary, unobfuscated shell syntax
# that executes their contents regardless of surrounding quotes or the outer
# command, and this function's own $(...)/backtick handling (below, inside
# the dquote branch) and its callers' segment-boundary treatment of them
# (arm-on-entry.sh's bp_wakeup_arm_check) exist specifically so that content
# is NOT treated as inert the way a genuinely-inert residual would be.
#
# Returns EMPTY (not the original text) if perl is unavailable or the input
# was empty -- callers MUST treat empty as "could not determine" and choose
# their own fail-open/fail-safe fallback; this helper does not decide that
# for them.
