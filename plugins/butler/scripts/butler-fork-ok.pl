# butler-fork-ok.pl -- the fork-override recorder (package 19 of blueprint
# hook-continuity-remake, Decision 64/91).
#
#   butler-fork-ok --reason '<why a fresh subagent will not do>'
#
# Contract: .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/hook-continuity-remake/specs/
# 19-fork-guard-spec.md sec 2.6. Architecture: docs/hook-architecture.md
# ("guard-fork.sh" rows, "Command binding").
#
# NO SESSION SELECTOR. This command never reads the caller's environment for
# a session identity; it learns its session only from a hook-written ticket
# (BpHook::take_ticket) for the exact argv it was given. There is no --token
# path (Decision 91 scope): stop tokens are accepted by
# butler-continuity off|silence and butler-hold only.
#
# All output is ONE line on stdout, prefixed "butler-fork-ok: "; stderr
# stays empty. Exit 0 = recorded; exit 1 = refused (never 2). Any unexpected
# die is caught by the top-level eval below.
