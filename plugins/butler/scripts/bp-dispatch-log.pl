#!/usr/bin/env perl
# bp-dispatch-log.pl — the per-dispatch budget record for a driver- or
# coordinator-issued Agent/Task worker dispatch (w02-dispatch-budget-and-
# interrupt).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# A coordinator gets max_turns (ledger frontmatter) and BP_ATTEMPT_CAP
# (bp-orchestrator.pl). A worker an interactive driver dispatches via the
# Agent/Task tool gets neither — no wall-clock deadline it can be compared
# against, no elapsed-time signal independent of the worker's own
# self-report. The cost, measured: one dispatch consumed roughly FOUR HOURS
# of wall clock while it self-reported 47 minutes. Any detector built on the
# agent's self-reported duration is built on sand.
#
# THE ONE RULE THIS FILE ENFORCES: elapsed time is measured DRIVER-SIDE,
# from the driver's own clock at launch (Decision 7). Nothing here ever
# reads a worker's own self-reported duration figure or anything shaped
# like it — elapsed_seconds is a plain subtraction of two driver-supplied
# numbers, $now - $started_at.
#
# Follows the family convention exactly (bp-runstate.pl's own shape): a
# pure/injectable-seam library (package BpDispatchLog) with a thin CLI
# (package main, guarded by `unless (caller)`), storage resolved the same
# way bp-runstate.pl::state_dir resolves its own root (CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR,
# else computed from __FILE__, overridable via --root), atomic
# tmp-then-rename writes copied from bp-runstate.pl::_write, including its
# corrected absolute-path mkdir -p (an earlier version of that pattern
# treated an absolute state dir as relative and left stray dirs under the
# repo root — never repeat that).
#
# --now EPOCH is a TEST-ONLY SEAM on the CLI layer (mirrors bp-watch.pl /
# bp-runstate.pl's own pure functions) — it overrides "the driver's own
# clock" so tests never sleep in real time. The library functions below
# already take $now as a plain argument.
#
# Runs standalone: perl plugins/butler/scripts/bp-dispatch-log.pl <cmd> ...

# RETENTION -- bug 20260908-225444-b9db.
#
# The store only ever GREW. `start` writes one record per dispatch and nothing
# ever removed one. Hook-written worker records USED TO be never `finish`ed at
# all: track-dispatch.sh's PostToolUse side had no correlation key by which it
# could identify which record to close (the id is hk-...-$$-$RANDOM, persisted
# nowhere), so those records sat at status `running` forever, aged into
# `stale`, and stayed.
#
# coordinator-context-discipline/01-deterministic-dispatch-tracking closed
# that blocker: track-dispatch.sh's PostToolUse half now recomputes the same
# `dispatch_key` the start half stamped and calls `resolve` (below), which
# DOES close the record. Retention still matters for two residuals this
# package deliberately leaves alone: B8 (a dispatch whose PostToolUse never
# fires at all -- a crashed process, a killed container -- still sits
# `running` forever; there is no timeout, by design) and any pre-existing
# record written before this package shipped.
#
# Two consumers then degrade SILENTLY at different thresholds, and the LOWER
# one bites first:
#
#   store >  512  the dashboard's agent detail vanishes wholesale
#                 ($RunState::MAX_DISPATCH_RECORDS, plugins/sandbox/scripts/
#                 RunState.pm -- an unbounded per-tick read is its own hazard,
#                 so standing aside is the correct LOCAL decision)
#   store > 2000  track-dispatch.sh stops recording entirely (its own bounded
#                 scan cap; standing aside over-cap is likewise correct locally)
#
# Neither cap is wrong. Both are the right answer to an unbounded store -- which
# is why the fix belongs HERE, in the thing that grows. With retention in place
# neither threshold is ever approached, and an operator never has to notice that
# agent rows quietly stopped appearing.
#
# WHY ONLY THE *LIVE* RECORDS ARE PROTECTED. A merely-STALE `running` record
# must be prunable: unfinished `running` records are the entire population that
# fills this directory, so protecting all of them would make retention a no-op
# that looks like a fix. is_live (running AND inside 4x its own budget) is
# protected unconditionally, whatever the count -- that is precisely what the
# dashboard is rendering right now, and what the hook's 120s dedup window
# matches against. Everything else is history, and history is what we trim.

# $RETENTION_KEEP -- how many non-live records survive a prune. Deliberately
# well under the 512 reader cap rather than merely under the 2000 writer cap:
# the panel this telemetry exists to feed goes blank at the LOWER number, so
# sizing to the higher one would leave the visible failure in place.

#               writer has ever produced has one; anything else in the directory
#               is a foreign file, and deleting it would be this function
#               exceeding its remit.
#   PROTECTED   is_live -- never returned, at any count.
#   PRUNABLE    everything else, newest-first by started_at; the first $keep
#               survive and the rest are returned.
#
# A record whose started_at is absent or non-numeric sorts as OLDEST (key -1)
# rather than being skipped: `elapsed` and `list` both already refuse to
# evaluate such a record, so it informs no consumer and is the first thing that

# norm(rec.X) eq_or_both_undef norm(crit.X) for both blueprint and package,
# with no `exists` gate. Spec-literal (§2.4). track-dispatch.sh's start and
# completion halves derive BPTOK/PKGTOK identically from the same
# BP_BLUEPRINT/BP_PACKAGE env vars, so when unset BOTH halves omit the key --
# the record carries no `blueprint`/`package` field and neither does crit,
# so strict eq_or_both_undef (both undef) still matches. The `exists` gate
# solved a problem the hook's own real usage never has, while opening a
# genuine cross-blueprint steal-close bug (MF-1/MEDIUM-3 in review).
#
# Two-tier selection: tier1 is an EXACT dispatch_key match; tier2 is every
# candidate with NO dispatch_key at all (the pre-this-change / no-key-given
# fallback). tier1 wins whenever it is non-empty. [Amended post-redteam,
# HIGH-2] tier2 is reached ONLY when the CALLER supplied no dispatch_key at
# all (crit.dispatch_key undef) -- a resolve call that DID supply a key and
# found no tier1 match returns undef outright, never falling through to
# steal-close an unrelated keyless record. Within the chosen tier, FIFO:
# oldest started_at first (absent/non-numeric sorts as -1, oldest --
# prune_plan's own convention), ties broken by id ascending for a

--blueprint / --package are optional, valid with `start`, `resolve` and
`outstanding`. --role is optional and valid ONLY with `start`; it is a
closed vocabulary of exactly coordinator, worker or judge. --dispatch-key
is optional and valid ONLY with `start` (stamps the record) and `resolve`
(query criteria); shape /^[a-z0-9-]{1,48}$/.

Exit codes: 0 ok · 2 usage error · 3 start refused (a running record already
exists for --id) · 4 elapsed/finish/resolve: no record, or the store could
not be read/written · 5 resolve: no running record matched the criteria
(not an error).

A `running` record is STALE once its elapsed time exceeds 4x its own
budget_seconds; `list` marks it `stale: true` but still shows it.

`outstanding`'s stdout prints outstanding_count/live_count/stale_count/
unevaluable_count/unreadable_count, in that order, then one `outstanding:`
line per counted record. unreadable_count counts a *.json file that exists
but failed to parse as a JSON object -- it cannot be proven NOT outstanding,
so it is folded into outstanding_count too (with every other field on its
`outstanding:` line reported as `-`/unknown); the invariant
`live_count + stale_count + unevaluable_count == outstanding_count` holds
exactly when unreadable_count is 0, and is short by unreadable_count
otherwise.

RETENTION. `start` prunes automatically once the store passes its high-water
mark, keeping the 256 most recent non-live records (bug 20260908-225444-b9db --
before this the store only ever grew, and two consumers went silently dark at
512 and at 2000 records). LIVE records are never pruned, whatever the count.
`prune` does the same pass on demand, ignoring the high-water gate. If a prune
leaves the store still over the 512 reader cap, one line is written to
.dispatch-log/retention-alarm.log: a cap reached silently is a permanent stop
nobody can discover.
