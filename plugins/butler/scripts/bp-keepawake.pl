# bp-keepawake.pl — the wake-lock, shared by every long-running butler driver.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AS A FILE.
#
# The keep-awake mechanism was implemented in bp-drive-next.pl, for the SOLO
# driver — the path where a human is sitting in the session and would notice a
# suspended host. The FLEET orchestrator, which runs headless coordinators for
# hours with nobody watching, held no wake-lock at all. The lock existed on the
# path that needs it least and was absent from the one that needs it most.
#
# That is not hypothetical. 3c661a0 records a host suspending mid-run: a
# watchdog armed for 1800s reported 7962s elapsed (2h13m). It fixed solo only.
#
# The obvious fix — copy the six helpers into bp-orchestrator.pl — is the same
# mistake this repo has already paid for twice: match_any lives in two files and
# needed t/108 to guard the copies, and the token floor lived in three places
# (one of them an invisible default), which is exactly how the keeper silently
# ran a 1-hour floor for hours after the gate had moved to ten minutes. So the
# wake-lock gets ONE definition and both drivers call it.
#
# WHAT IT ACTUATES. The sandbox plugin's keep-awake.ps1, rather than
# re-deriving the P/Invoke. Both plugins ship from the same tree, so the relative
# path holds in the clone, in the live install, and under the container's
# marketplace mount.
#
# THIS BLOCK USED TO REPEAT THE HELPER'S CLAIM that ES_DISPLAY_REQUIRED is
# load-bearing on Modern Standby. MEASURED FALSE 2026-09-17 and dropped from the
# helper: the machine entered connected standby with that request held and
# refreshing, for "Reason: Idle Timeout", which no ES_* flag addresses. The
# reasoning now lives in ONE place -- keep-awake.ps1's header -- rather than
# being restated here, because a claim copied into a second file is a claim that
# gets corrected in only one of them. Read it there.
#
# WE PASS -PidFile, AND THE REASON MATTERS — the opposite choice leaked 2.7 GB.
#
# The original comment here said we deliberately did NOT pass it, because "it
# would write its own Windows pid over ours". That is exactly backwards, and it
# was measured on 2026-08-13: 52 orphaned keep-awake PowerShells, ~52 MB each,
# holding 2.7 GB and 52 simultaneous ES_CONTINUOUS wake-locks.
#
# On Git-for-Windows perl, fork() is EMULATED with threads and returns a
# PSEUDO-process id (447298, say) that is meaningful only inside the perl
# process that created it. Every `bp-drive-next.pl next` is a FRESH perl
# process, so its `kill(0, $pid)` against a pseudo-pid written by some earlier
# process always fails. The idempotency check therefore never fired: each
# invocation concluded "no live lock" and spawned another one, and the release
# path could not kill the old one either, for the same reason. The mechanism
# leaked one PowerShell per invocation, forever.
#
# The helper's own $PID is a REAL Windows pid, valid across processes, and
# keep-awake.ps1 removes the file on exit — so a stale file means a dead helper
# and correctly triggers a respawn. That is the identity we need. Ours never was.
#
# Degrades honestly: no Windows, no helper, or a failed fork means no lock and a
# logged warning — never a false claim of holding one. That failure mode is the
# whole reason 3c661a0 exists (the production spawn/kill defaults were empty
# subs, so the director REPORTED managing a lock while holding none).

# THE HOLE THIS CLOSES, MEASURED 2026-09-15: fifteen live keep-awake.ps1
# helpers from a single registry, and the machine kept awake by all of them.
# spawn() returns as soon as the fork+exec is away, but keep-awake.ps1 does not
# write its own pid until PowerShell has started — of the order of a second, and
# more on a loaded box. Every apply() inside that window saw no pid file at all,
# concluded "no lock here", and spawned another. The idempotence check was
# perfect and simply had nothing to look at yet.
#
# So spawning now CLAIMS the pid file first, and an unfilled claim is read as
# "starting". 30s is far beyond any plausible PowerShell start and far short of
# the 900s lease, so a helper that truly failed to come up is still replaced

# pseudo-processes; against an unrelated native pid — which is exactly what the
# keep-awake helper is — it reports "dead" for a perfectly healthy process.
#
# That was the second half of the 2026-08-13 leak, and it hid behind the first:
# fixing the recorded pid alone changed nothing, because the CHECK was broken
# too. Measured directly — with a real, running helper pid in the file, two
# further invocations still spawned two more locks.
#
# So on Windows, ask Windows. tasklist costs one process per invocation, which
# at this cadence (once per director tick) is nothing next to leaking a 52 MB
# PowerShell forever.
