# bp-keepawake.pl — the wake-lock, shared by every long-running butler driver.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AS A FILE.
#
# The keep-awake mechanism was implemented in bp-drive-next.pl, for the SOLO
# driver — the path where a human is sitting in the session and would notice a
# suspended host. The FLEET orchestrator, which runs headless coordinators for
# hours with nobody watching, held no wake-lock at all. The lock existed on the
# path that needs it least and was absent from the one that needs it most.
#
# That is not hypothetical. 3c661a0 records a host suspending mid-run: a
# watchdog armed for 1800s reported 7962s elapsed (2h13m). It fixed solo only.
#
# The obvious fix — copy the six helpers into bp-orchestrator.pl — is the same
# mistake this repo has already paid for twice: match_any lives in two files and
# needed t/108 to guard the copies, and the token floor lived in three places
# (one of them an invisible default), which is exactly how the keeper silently
# ran a 1-hour floor for hours after the gate had moved to ten minutes. So the
# wake-lock gets ONE definition and both drivers call it.
#
# WHAT IT ACTUATES. The sandbox plugin's keep-awake.ps1, rather than
# re-deriving the P/Invoke. That helper documents the non-obvious part:
# ES_DISPLAY_REQUIRED is load-bearing on Modern Standby (S0) machines, where
# ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED alone does NOT hold the box out of connected standby. Both
# plugins ship from the same tree, so the relative path holds in the clone, in
# the live install, and under the container's marketplace mount.
#
# WE PASS -PidFile, AND THE REASON MATTERS — the opposite choice leaked 2.7 GB.
#
# The original comment here said we deliberately did NOT pass it, because "it
# would write its own Windows pid over ours". That is exactly backwards, and it
# was measured on 2026-08-13: 52 orphaned keep-awake PowerShells, ~52 MB each,
# holding 2.7 GB and 52 simultaneous ES_CONTINUOUS wake-locks.
#
# On Git-for-Windows perl, fork() is EMULATED with threads and returns a
# PSEUDO-process id (447298, say) that is meaningful only inside the perl
# process that created it. Every `bp-drive-next.pl next` is a FRESH perl
# process, so its `kill(0, $pid)` against a pseudo-pid written by some earlier
# process always fails. The idempotency check therefore never fired: each
# invocation concluded "no live lock" and spawned another one, and the release
# path could not kill the old one either, for the same reason. The mechanism
# leaked one PowerShell per invocation, forever.
#
# The helper's own $PID is a REAL Windows pid, valid across processes, and
# keep-awake.ps1 removes the file on exit — so a stale file means a dead helper
# and correctly triggers a respawn. That is the identity we need. Ours never was.
#
# Degrades honestly: no Windows, no helper, or a failed fork means no lock and a
# logged warning — never a false claim of holding one. That failure mode is the
# whole reason 3c661a0 exists (the production spawn/kill defaults were empty
# subs, so the director REPORTED managing a lock while holding none).
