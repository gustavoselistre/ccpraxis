# bp-hooks-selftest.sh — A8 / Decision #31 startup self-assert.
#
# Proves, with a LIVE worker subagent, that butler's PreToolUse containment
# (guard-writes.sh) actually DENIES an out-of-scope edit made by a *subagent*.
# This is the load-bearing assumption that A4's graceful-gate and ALL write
# containment depend on: that Claude Code fires PreToolUse hooks for subagent
# tool calls in THIS version. The docs say it does and the structure assumes it
# (A0 probe 3) — but two independent doc reads disagreed once and CC behavior can
# change across versions, so we self-assert rather than trust silently (#31). If
# containment is not firing we FAIL LOUD and the fleet refuses to start.
#
# Cost-aware: a live `claude -p` costs tokens + ~30s, so a PASS is CACHED, keyed
# by a hash of the hook scripts + the claude version. Subsequent runs are an
# instant cache hit until a hook script changes or claude is upgraded (or --force).
#
# Registration: hooks are loaded via `claude --settings` (additive, points at the
# REAL hook scripts) so the self-test NEVER mutates the live ~/.claude/settings.json
# and is self-contained (does not depend on the plugin being installed). In the
# real runtime the installed plugin's hooks ALSO fire, so the test is, if anything,
# stricter than production.
#
# Usage: bp-hooks-selftest.sh [--quiet] [--force]
#   exit 0 = pass (live or cached) | 3 = containment FAILED / inconclusive | 2 = setup error
# Override: BP_SKIP_HOOKS_SELFTEST=1 skips it (deliberate opt-out; logs loudly).
