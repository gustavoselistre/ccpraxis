# bp-statusline.pl -- b37-spend-surfaces C8: the compact spend form for
# Claude Code's statusline. A plain filter script (stdin JSON -> stdout
# bytes, one line), following the same convention as this repo's existing
# scripts/statusline.pl (stdin JSON in, rendered bytes out), but this is a
# NEW, DIFFERENT file: it renders b36/b37's spend struct, not context/plan
# usage.
#
# Input (stdin, JSON): { spend => \%spend, now => N, width => N }
#   \%spend is the same struct SpendPanel::status() consumes (spec S0/S1;
#   see SpendPanel.pm's header for the full shape).
#
# Output (stdout, raw bytes, ONE line, no trailing newline): a compact
# rendering fit to EXACTLY $width display columns, measured and truncated
# via Dashboard's s04 display-width core (display_width/fit_spans/
# spans_text/spans_width) -- never raw `length`, never mid-glyph (fit_spans'
# whole-glyph-drop rule, D4).
#
# Total: never dies, whatever the input (malformed JSON, missing spend,
# missing SpendPanel/Dashboard) -- worst case prints an empty/blank line.

# path while Dashboard.pm's own `require Theme` keys 'Theme.pm' -- the two
# never match, so Theme.pm compiled TWICE per invocation and emitted ~4 KB of
# "Subroutine ... redefined" warnings on every render of a statusline.
# Naming the file relative to a @INC entry keys 'Theme.pm', which is the key
# the sibling module will look for, so the second require is the no-op it

# on the eval is the only test that distinguishes the two.
#
# The same localised @INC serves a second purpose for Dashboard.pm, which is
# not cosmetic: Dashboard's own top-level `require tui::Layout` /
