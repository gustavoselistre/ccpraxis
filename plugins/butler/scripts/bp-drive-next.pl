# bp-drive-next.pl — the mechanical director for /butler:drive-solo.
# Stateless-from-disk: every `next` recomputes from ledgers + <data>/.drive-solo/.
#
# USAGE
#   bp-drive-next.pl next --scope <spec>
#   bp-drive-next.pl record-order <bp> [<bp> …]
#   bp-drive-next.pl park <blueprint> <reason…>
#   bp-drive-next.pl --help
#
# SUBCOMMANDS
#   next --scope <spec>
#       Print exactly ONE next-action JSON (below) to stdout, single line.
#       <spec> = one blueprint name | comma/space list of names | "all" (or empty)
#       = all audited blueprints. <spec> resolves mechanically to the candidate SET
#       and is used ONLY for need-order candidates; once order.json exists it is the
#       authoritative scope+order and --scope is ignored.
#   record-order <bp> [<bp> …]
#       Persist the SESSION-judged blueprint order to order.json. The director never
#       invents order — it only persists and serves it.
#   park <blueprint> <reason…>
#       Record a blueprint-level park (idempotent) to parks.json and log it. A parked
#       blueprint is settled: never driven, excluded from every pending list.
#
# NEXT-ACTION JSON  (exactly one per `next`)
#   {"action":"need-order","candidates":[…]}          no order yet; session must judge+record
#   {"action":"run-package","blueprint":B,"package":P} drive this package next

#                                                      refreshed; the wake-lock is released and the
#                                                      run ends. NOT a pause: a pause promises a
#                                                      resume, and there is none until a human
#                                                      re-authenticates.
#   {"action":"blueprint-done","blueprint":B,"pending":[…]} B settled; pending = remaining bps to re-eval
#   {"action":"in-flight","blueprint":B,"packages":[…],"running":[…]}
#                                                      nothing dispatchable right now, but B still
#                                                      holds non-terminal packages (typically owned by
#                                                      a concurrent worker). NOT completion: stopping
#                                                      here kills the run mid-package.
#   {"action":"done"}                                  every in-scope blueprint is done-or-parked
#
#   Keep-awake is a director-managed SIDE EFFECT (started when work is runnable or a
#   timed auto-resume is pending; stopped when settled) — never an action.
#
# GOVERNOR VERDICT CONSUMED  (from bp-usage-gate.pl verdict — pkg-02)
#   {"action":"ok"|"pause-usage"|"pause-token"|"unavailable","until_epoch":E|null,"reason":…}
#   ok           → proceed
#   pause-usage  → pause reason=usage, until_epoch=E
#   pause-token  → attempt a refresh (bp-token-keeper). Recovered → proceed;
#                  failed → action=stop, wake-lock released, error logged.
#                  Solo NEVER pauses for token expiry — see _token_recover.

# token, and only stops if that genuinely fails.
#
# The refresh is not re-derived here. `bp-token-keeper.pl` already implements
# it -- the OAuth token endpoint, the request shape, atomic write-back under
# flock with a re-read stand-down, temp+rename, JSON validation, mode
# preservation and 429 backoff. Re-implementing any of that would be a second,
# less-tested writer for the credential store, which is the last file in the
# system that should have two.
#
# Returns ($recovered, $detail). $detail is always a short human string; it goes
# to the run log and, on failure, out in the action, so a run that stops for
# this reason explains itself without anyone reading code.
#
# The `refresh` opt is the test seam. Production default calls the keeper.

    # Reaching here means nothing in scope can progress without a human, so this

    #   * derived state (blueprint.md's own `status:`, its package-status table,
    #     runs/registry.json, a stale runs/.orchestrator) is repaired against the
    #     ledgers, which are the truth;
    #   * a blueprint whose packages are ALL delivered is advanced to `done` and
    #     filed into blueprints/_archive/.
    #
    # Archiving is enabled HERE and nowhere else in the automatic path. It is a
    # directory move, so it must only run where nothing holds the directory —
    # true at this point and not true inside the orchestrator (which lives in it)
    # or during a status read (which may be observing a run about to relaunch).
    # The director's own state lives in <data>/.drive-solo/, outside every
    # blueprint, so moving one cannot disturb it.
    #
    # A blueprint that is merely settled — parked or blocked awaiting a human —
    # is NOT all-delivered and is therefore left exactly where it is. bp-lifecycle
    # enforces that; the drive loop does not need to re-decide it.

bp-drive-next.pl — the mechanical director for /butler:drive-solo.
Stateless-from-disk: every `next` recomputes from ledgers + <data>/.drive-solo/.

USAGE
  bp-drive-next.pl next --scope <spec>
  bp-drive-next.pl record-order <bp> [<bp> …]
  bp-drive-next.pl park <blueprint> <reason…>
  bp-drive-next.pl --help

SUBCOMMANDS
  next --scope <spec>
      Print exactly ONE next-action JSON (below) to stdout, single line.
      <spec> = one blueprint name | comma/space list of names | "all" (or empty)
      = all audited blueprints. <spec> resolves mechanically to the candidate SET
      and is used ONLY for need-order candidates; once order.json exists it is the
      authoritative scope+order and --scope is ignored.
  record-order <bp> [<bp> …]
      Persist the SESSION-judged blueprint order to order.json. The director never
      invents order — it only persists and serves it.
  park <blueprint> <reason…>
      Record a blueprint-level park (idempotent) to parks.json and log it. A parked
      blueprint is settled: never driven, excluded from every pending list.

NEXT-ACTION JSON  (exactly one per `next`)
  {"action":"need-order","candidates":[…]}          no order yet; session must judge+record
  {"action":"run-package","blueprint":B,"package":P} drive this package next
  {"action":"pause","until_epoch":E,"reason":"usage"} timed auto-resume at epoch E
  {"action":"stop","reason":"token-refresh-failed","detail":…} token could not be
                                                     refreshed; the wake-lock is released and the
                                                     run ends. NOT a pause: a pause promises a
                                                     resume, and there is none until a human
                                                     re-authenticates.
  {"action":"blueprint-done","blueprint":B,"pending":[…]} B settled; pending = remaining bps to re-eval
  {"action":"in-flight","blueprint":B,"packages":[…],"running":[…]}
                                                     nothing dispatchable right now, but B still
                                                     holds non-terminal packages (typically owned by
                                                     a concurrent worker). NOT completion: stopping
                                                     here kills the run mid-package.
  {"action":"done"}                                  every in-scope blueprint is done-or-parked

  Keep-awake is a director-managed SIDE EFFECT (started when work is runnable or a
  timed auto-resume is pending; stopped when settled) — never an action.

GOVERNOR VERDICT CONSUMED  (from bp-usage-gate.pl verdict — pkg-02)
  {"action":"ok"|"pause-usage"|"pause-token"|"unavailable","until_epoch":E|null,"reason":…}
  ok           → proceed
  pause-usage  → pause reason=usage, until_epoch=E
  pause-token  → attempt a refresh (bp-token-keeper). Recovered → proceed;
                 failed → action=stop, wake-lock released, error logged.
                 Solo NEVER pauses for token expiry — see _token_recover.
  unavailable  → retry a few times, then degrade-and-proceed (log "governance degraded")

STATE  (<data>/.drive-solo/, all director-owned)
  order.json      {"order":[…],"recorded_at":<epoch>}
  parks.json      [{"blueprint":…,"reason":…,"at":<epoch>}, …]
  announced.json  {"announced":[…]}   blueprints whose blueprint-done already fired
  keepawake.pid   PID of the wake-lock process (host only; sandbox = no file)
  run.md          append-only structured run log

# marketplaces dir) that has no blueprints/. read_state then builds an empty DAG,
# every blueprint looks settled, and `next` silently emits blueprint-done→done
# despite pending work. This mirrors bp-lib.sh's bp_project_root()+bp_data_dir()
# so the perl director and the bash helpers agree on exactly one root.
