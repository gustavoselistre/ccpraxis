# bp-drive-next.pl — the mechanical director for /butler:drive-solo.
# Stateless-from-disk: every `next` recomputes from ledgers + <data>/.drive-solo/.
#
# USAGE
#   bp-drive-next.pl next --scope <spec>
#   bp-drive-next.pl record-order <bp> [<bp> …]
#   bp-drive-next.pl park <blueprint> <reason…>
#   bp-drive-next.pl --help
#
# SUBCOMMANDS
#   next --scope <spec>
#       Print exactly ONE next-action JSON (below) to stdout, single line.
#       <spec> = one blueprint name | comma/space list of names | "all" (or empty)
#       = all audited blueprints. <spec> resolves mechanically to the candidate SET
#       and is used ONLY for need-order candidates; once order.json exists it is the
#       authoritative scope+order and --scope is ignored.
#   record-order <bp> [<bp> …]
#       Persist the SESSION-judged blueprint order to order.json. The director never
#       invents order — it only persists and serves it.
#   park <blueprint> <reason…>
#       Record a blueprint-level park (idempotent) to parks.json and log it. A parked
#       blueprint is settled: never driven, excluded from every pending list.
#
# NEXT-ACTION JSON  (exactly one per `next`)
#   {"action":"need-order","candidates":[…]}          no order yet; session must judge+record

#                                                      run ends. NOT a pause: a pause promises a
#                                                      resume, and there is none until a human
#                                                      re-authenticates.

#                                                      a concurrent worker). NOT completion: stopping
#                                                      here kills the run mid-package.
#   {"action":"done"}                                  every in-scope blueprint is done-or-parked
#

# HOLDING THE WAKE-LOCK ACROSS A PAUSE IS A PROMISE ABOUT RESUMING. A usage pause
# auto-resumes, and the machine has to still be awake when the window reopens --
# which is why 'pause-pending' is one of the two phases should_be_on() holds for.
#
# That reasoning is sound for the FIVE-HOUR usage window, which cannot reopen
# more than five hours out. It is not sound for the SEVEN-DAY window. Measured on
# this host 2026-09-18, the governor returned
#   {"action":"pause","reason":"usage","until_epoch":1790013600}
# with seven_day at 86%, resetting 2026-09-21T18:00Z -- 88 hours away.
# 'pause-pending' would have held a laptop awake from Friday morning until Monday
# evening waiting for it. Nobody expects that, and nobody would ask for it.
#
# Past the horizon the honest phase is 'settled': release the lock, let the
# machine sleep, and let whoever comes back wake it. The pause ACTION is
# byte-identical either way -- this decides only whether the machine is held
# awake, never what any caller sees.
#
# An UNDEFINED until_epoch keeps the old behaviour and HOLDS. That is the
# pre-existing semantics, it is the case no measurement covers, and a short pause
# wrongly released is a broken auto-resume -- so the change stays scoped to the
# case actually observed.

# it -- the OAuth token endpoint, the request shape, atomic write-back under
# flock with a re-read stand-down, temp+rename, JSON validation, mode
# preservation and 429 backoff. Re-implementing any of that would be a second,
# less-tested writer for the credential store, which is the last file in the
# system that should have two.

    # need-order with candidates:[] anyway. That prompt is UNANSWERABLE, and it
    # is a closed loop rather than a stall: record-order refuses an empty list,
    # so the session cannot answer it; `next` returns it again on every call;
    # gate-drive-loop.sh treats any non-done/pause action as actionable work and
    # blocks the stop for it; and keepawake_apply('active') holds the machine
    # awake over a run containing no work at all.
    #
    # Observed 2026-08-25: the last blueprint was archived, blueprints/ held only
    # _archive/, and the driver could not end its turn — the gate demanded it
    # "do the next thing NOW" over zero candidates.
    #
    # 'done' asserts "every in-scope blueprint is done-or-parked". That is
    # vacuously true of an empty scope, and it settles keep-awake, which is what
    # an empty scope actually needs. This runs BEFORE B2 so the degenerate case
    # never reaches the ordering logic at all.
    # EMPTY IS NOT THE SAME AS MALFORMED, and conflating them is a
    # false-settled bug rather than a cosmetic one.
    #
    # Candidate discovery requires blueprint.md, so a directory under
    # blueprints/ that HAS packages but no blueprint.md is silently skipped and
    # lands here looking identical to "nothing is there". Reporting `done` over
    # it is actively dangerous: bp-watchdog.pl branches on the action string and
    # treats `done` as absolute ("The director reports no remaining work. Do not
    # re-arm."), so a package ledger sitting at status: running would be
    # declared settled and the dead-man's switch disarmed over a wedged run.

bp-drive-next.pl — the mechanical director for /butler:drive-solo.
Stateless-from-disk: every `next` recomputes from ledgers + <data>/.drive-solo/.

USAGE
  bp-drive-next.pl next --scope <spec>
  bp-drive-next.pl record-order <bp> [<bp> …]
  bp-drive-next.pl park <blueprint> <reason…>
  bp-drive-next.pl --help

SUBCOMMANDS
  next --scope <spec>
      Print exactly ONE next-action JSON (below) to stdout, single line.
      <spec> = one blueprint name | comma/space list of names | "all" (or empty)
      = all audited blueprints. <spec> resolves mechanically to the candidate SET
      and is used ONLY for need-order candidates; once order.json exists it is the
      authoritative scope+order and --scope is ignored.
  record-order <bp> [<bp> …]
      Persist the SESSION-judged blueprint order to order.json. The director never
      invents order — it only persists and serves it.
  park <blueprint> <reason…>
      Record a blueprint-level park (idempotent) to parks.json and log it. A parked
      blueprint is settled: never driven, excluded from every pending list.

NEXT-ACTION JSON  (exactly one per `next`)
  {"action":"need-order","candidates":[…]}          no order yet; session must judge+record
  {"action":"run-package","blueprint":B,"package":P} drive this package next
  {"action":"pause","until_epoch":E,"reason":"usage"} timed auto-resume at epoch E
  {"action":"stop","reason":"token-refresh-failed","detail":…} token could not be
                                                     refreshed; the wake-lock is released and the
                                                     run ends. NOT a pause: a pause promises a
                                                     resume, and there is none until a human
                                                     re-authenticates.
  {"action":"blueprint-done","blueprint":B,"pending":[…]} B settled; pending = remaining bps to re-eval
  {"action":"in-flight","blueprint":B,"packages":[…],"running":[…]}
                                                     nothing dispatchable right now, but B still
                                                     holds non-terminal packages (typically owned by
                                                     a concurrent worker). NOT completion: stopping
                                                     here kills the run mid-package.
  {"action":"done"}                                  every in-scope blueprint is done-or-parked

  Keep-awake is a director-managed SIDE EFFECT (started when work is runnable or a
  timed auto-resume is pending; stopped when settled) — never an action.

GOVERNOR VERDICT CONSUMED  (from bp-usage-gate.pl verdict — pkg-02)
  {"action":"ok"|"pause-usage"|"pause-token"|"unavailable","until_epoch":E|null,"reason":…}
  ok           → proceed
  pause-usage  → pause reason=usage, until_epoch=E
  pause-token  → attempt a refresh (bp-token-keeper). Recovered → proceed;
                 failed → action=stop, wake-lock released, error logged.
                 Solo NEVER pauses for token expiry — see _token_recover.
  unavailable  → retry a few times, then degrade-and-proceed (log "governance degraded")

STATE  (<data>/.drive-solo/, all director-owned)
  order.json      {"order":[…],"recorded_at":<epoch>}
  parks.json      [{"blueprint":…,"reason":…,"at":<epoch>}, …]
  announced.json  {"announced":[…]}   blueprints whose blueprint-done already fired
  current.json    {"blueprint":…,"package":…,"recorded_at":<epoch>}   the CURRENT
                  package pointer: written on run-package, removed on done/stop,
                  left alone otherwise (including in-flight); read by
                  lib.sh's bp_driver_context so the write/ledger guards reach a
                  driver session; the write is never fatal to `next`.
  inflight.json   {"packages":[{"blueprint":…,"package":…,"ledger":…,"since":<epoch>}],
                  "updated_at":<epoch>}   the project-level in-flight set:
                  added on run-package, pruned once its ledger turns terminal.
                  BUTLER_CONCURRENCY=1 enables concurrent hand-out (a further
                  ready package disjoint from every in-flight write set); off,
                  one entry at a time, exactly as today.

# PROJECT-ANCHORED DATA-DIR RESOLUTION

# marketplaces dir) that has no blueprints/. read_state then builds an empty DAG,
# every blueprint looks settled, and `next` silently emits blueprint-done→done
# despite pending work. This mirrors bp-lib.sh's bp_project_root()+bp_data_dir()
# so the perl director and the bash helpers agree on exactly one root.
