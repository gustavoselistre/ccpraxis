# bp-watchdog.pl — the drive-solo run's dead-man's switch.
#
# SUPERSEDED by bp-watch.pl (w01-bp-watch), for the drive-solo "wedged
# worker" role this file's own header used to describe below. Neither
# reporter/SKILL.md nor drive-solo/SKILL.md arms this file any more, as of
# that package. Why: snapshot() below (:102-136) has NO subject-scoping
# argument at all -- it walks the ENTIRE .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints
# tree with File::Find, so a driver's own ledger edit is indistinguishable
# from a worker's progress. That is not historical: it fired live in this
# very repo's session history, reporting VERDICT: PROGRESS three times
# during a real four-hour stall, and it is structurally incapable of being
# fixed by scoping it "a bit better" -- bp-watch.pl's artifact_snapshot()/
# artifact_changed() close the same gap correctly, scoped to exactly the
# paths a caller configures, and additionally poll on a real condition
# rather than a fixed --sleep. This file's CODE below is intentionally
# UNCHANGED (this is a header-only edit) and t/drive-loop-watchdog.t stays green,
# byte-for-byte, because nothing it exercises changed -- superseding in
# doctrine is the chosen fix, not a rewrite of internals nothing calls
# again. See .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/butler-and-dashboard-overhaul/
# specs/w01-bp-watch-spec.md §2.3/§3.6 for the full ruling.
#
# WHAT PROBLEM THIS SOLVES, AND WHY THE STOP GATE IS NOT ENOUGH
#
# gate-drive-loop.sh (Stop hook) catches a driver turn that ends with nothing
# scheduled to continue the run. That is one of two failure modes, and it is
# the easier one.
#
# The other is WEDGED rather than STOPPED: the driver dispatches a worker, the
# turn legitimately ends (a wake-up WAS scheduled), and the notification never
# arrives — the worker hung, died silently, or is itself waiting on something
# that will never happen. No Stop event ever fires, so no Stop hook can help.
# The session sits idle, indefinitely, looking exactly like a session that is
# working. The DAME field report's batch-1 #11 is this failure in the wild: an
# orphaned watcher still looping after SEVENTEEN HOURS, counted as live the
# whole time by a liveness probe that matched its own command line.
#
# So this is the suspenders to the Stop gate's belt. It converts "silent death"
# into "at most --sleep seconds of silence".
#
# HOW IT IS USED (the whole protocol)
#
#   1. The driver arms it ONCE, backgrounded:
#        perl bp-watchdog.pl --sleep 1800 --arm
#   2. A backgrounded Bash call notifies the session when it exits. So the
#      watchdog's own expiry IS a wake-up the driver controls. Even if every
#      other wake-up in the run is lost, the session revives on this one.
#   3. On expiry it prints a verdict — SETTLED / PROGRESS / STALLED — plus, when
#      stalled, a diagnosis of WHAT is wedged.
#   4. The driver acts: SETTLED -> stop. PROGRESS -> re-arm. STALLED ->
#      investigate the named cause, then re-arm.
#
# IT MUST NOT BECOME THE THING IT DETECTS
#
# A watchdog that spins, or waits on a condition that can never be true, is
# just another wedged watcher — the exact defect DAME reported. So, by
# construction:
#   * ONE sleep, then exit. No loop, no polling, no condition-waiting. The
#     coordinator protocol forbids sleep-spin shapes and wait-shape-guard.sh
#     mechanically denies them; this file must never grow one.
#   * It never kills anything and never writes into a blueprint. It observes
#     and reports. Remediation is a judgment call and stays with the driver.
#   * Every failure path still prints a verdict and exits 0. A watchdog that
#     dies quietly is strictly worse than none, because its silence is
#     indistinguishable from "all well".
#
# Exit status is ALWAYS 0. The verdict is on stdout, for a human and for the
# driver to read. Do not branch on $?.

  --arm        take a snapshot, sleep, take another, print a verdict. This is
               the normal mode; run it with run_in_background so its exit
               notifies the session.
  --snapshot   print the current state snapshot and exit (no sleep). For
               testing, and for a driver that wants a reading right now.
  --sleep N    seconds to wait before the second snapshot (default 1800).
  --data DIR   the .ccpraxis-local-data dir; default: discovered upward from cwd.

Always exits 0. The verdict is on stdout: SETTLED | PROGRESS | STALLED.

    # path list. The env var sidesteps both, and it sits above every cwd-derived
    # guess in the director's own resolution order (--data-dir > $CCPRAXIS_DATA_DIR
    # > $BP_PROJECT_ROOT > git toplevel > walk-up > cwd), which is precisely the
    # guess it has to beat.
