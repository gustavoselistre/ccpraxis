#!/usr/bin/env perl
# bp-orchestrator.pl — the deterministic, TOKEN-FREE orchestrator process-management
# loop for A3. It assembles the already-built decision-core (bp-govern, bp-contract,
# bp-token-keeper, bp-log) into the standing loop that drives a `dispatch-fleet` run
# inside the sandbox. There is NO Claude in this script (Decision #5/#14).
#
# What it does each tick (fast watch tick, ~10s — so a completion is acted on in
# seconds, not at the fallback-timer granularity):
#   • WATCH    — coordinator liveness (PID) + runs/<pkg>.jsonl growth (free signals).
#   • LAUNCH   — the instant a slot frees / a dep completes, compute newly-ready
#                packages off the blueprint DAG (deps ✅ + disjoint write-sets) and
#                launch them via bp-launch.sh, cap-bounded (BP_MAX_PARALLEL).
#   • WATCHDOG — dead→relaunch (warm/cold per resume economics); alive+log-flat→
#                kill+cold-relaunch; loop-guard past an attempt cap → blocked + queue
#                a runs/needs-you/ decision.
#   • USAGE    — burn-rate-adaptive poll of /api/oauth/usage (validated via
#                BpContract::validate_usage; cadence via BpGovern::next_cadence);
#                derived-trip pause via BpGovern::should_pause → write runs/.paused.
#   • TOKEN    — BpKeeper::keeper_tick on cadence; honor its action.
#   • BUSY     — touch /tmp/.butler-busy while work active OR auto-resume-pending;
#                NOT while the only outstanding work is parked-for-human.
#   • RESUME   — after resets_at (+ jitter), clear runs/.paused and relaunch.
#   • MARKER   — runs/.orchestrator (PID + flock) on start; removed on clean exit.
#   • FAIL-SAFE— telemetry/auth/contract loss ⇒ graceful pause, never fly blind.
#   • LOG      — every poll/refresh/pause/resume via BpLog::event to
#                runs/orchestrator.log (Decision #30); never a secret value.
#
# DESIGN: every DECISION the loop makes is a PURE function (top of file) that is
# unit-tested with an injected clock / registry / transport (Decision #25, t/06).
# The loop itself is the thin shell that reads disk, calls the decisions, and acts;
# its side-effecting seams (launch, http_get, http_post, clock) are injectable so a
# `--once` assembly test can drive it without the network or a real `claude`.

# the existing "unreadable -> queue anyway" branch already does the honest

# driver review (see implementer-step4.md): 'judge-starved' is DELIBERATELY
# OMITTED, unlike the spec's §2.3 worked table -- but NOT for the reason first
# given. Its two call sites (bp-orchestrator.pl, the two harvest-starvation
# park branches) are guarded by `$st eq 'done'` as a precondition for reaching
# the queue_needs_you call -- but `$st` is a once-per-tick SNAPSHOT
# (`_load_state`, read once at tick-start), never re-read for the rest of the
# tick. A human running `bp-answer-decision.pl` mid-tick can flip the ledger's
# real status after the snapshot but before either branch runs, so the
# precondition being "structural" was never true of the LIVE ledger, only of
# the stale value the tick captured (fixbatch step7 / red-team MAJOR). Gating
# on `['done','dropped']` here would still be wrong, unconditionally refusing
# the ORDINARY case (status genuinely still 'done' while the harvest audit is
# unresolved, which is what the MUST-STAY-GREEN t/write-guard-sites.t S4/
# AC14 control pins) -- the table row was never the right tool for a

# re-reads the ledger's live `status:` immediately before either branch
# commits to queuing, under the same lock bp-answer-decision.pl's status
# writes take, and refuses if it no longer reads 'done' -- a01's
# re-read-under-the-lock convention, applied to the resource (the ledger)
# this gate was missing rather than to this table (which cannot express a

# may NEVER decide (bp-resolve.pl's tag-only branch), so choosing one of them is
# choosing to wake a human -- possibly at 3am, possibly for hours, since a
# blocked fleet waits until someone reads it.
#
# 'operational' did not say that. It read as "about the machinery", which is a
# statement about topic, and so it collected every escalation that felt
# infrastructural whether or not a human could do anything about it. It became
# the single largest category in this file -- nine call sites, more than any
# other -- and it is the one category with no autonomous exit. Operator, on the
# run this fixes: "It stopped an overnight run blocking on me to answer some
# random bullshit question that is an implementation detail."
#
# The name now asks the question that decides the answer: does this need the
# operator's HANDS (re-authenticate, repair the environment, choose between two
# products)? If a competent agent with the resolver's four actions could clear
# it, it is not operator-action, however infrastructural it looks.

#
# Which is why filing product or operator-action directly is a heavy thing to
# do: those are NOT in this list, so the resolver never sees the record at all.

# queued (it must never look like a park -- that's b18's territory).

# can both be "otherwise ready" simultaneously when nothing is running yet
# (nothing to gate on). Launching both in the same round would still run them
# concurrently, so at most one requires_clean_tree package is admitted per
# call -- chosen via order_ready (already deterministic; no new tie-break).
# The rest simply remain pending and are reconsidered next call, once the

# See spec-b08 §2.6. Determines whether the run is genuinely stalled (nothing
# running, nothing pending-and-ready) and, if so, classifies WHY: a
# blocked/parked dependency (routable to the b07 remediation engine) or a
# structurally unresolvable one (dangling token, ambiguous token, a dropped
# dependency, or a dependency cycle -- none of which any coordinator can fix).
#
# Recursion exclusion (load-bearing, mirrors conformance_registry's exclusion):
# a package flagged `remediation => 1` or named `remediation-*` is invisible to
# every computation below -- neither pending, nor ready, nor a blocker, nor a
# member of unresolvable. Without this, a remediation package b08 itself caused
# to be authored would be seen as stalled/blocking and resubmitted every tick,
# a self-feeding loop that eats rounds_cap and then goes permanently quiet -- a
# WORSE silent stall than the one this function removes. A normal package's
# dependency edge POINTING AT an excluded package is likewise treated as
# already-satisfied (never a blocker, never unresolvable): that edge is
# artifact-of-remediation bookkeeping, not a real graph dependency.
#
# Exhaustiveness argument: with nothing running, ready_packages returns every
# pending package whose deps are met. If none are, every pending package has
# an unmet dep; following unmet deps through a finite set must terminate in a
# terminal-but-not-done target, an unresolvable token, or a cycle. So

# The orchestrator log stamps a usage_poll roughly every 60s. On 2026-09-17 it
# contained two gaps -- 186.2 and 203.9 minutes -- with NO events of any kind,
# and `grep -ic suspend` over the whole log returned 0. Six and a half hours of
# wall time passed, in a log with a sixty-second heartbeat, and nothing recorded
# that anything had happened.
#
# The absence was then read as evidence by two other consumers. The token keeper
# woke four seconds after the first gap, found the OAuth token under its refresh
# floor, got HTTP 400, and paused the fleet with manual=1 while alerting that the
# host and sandbox token GRANTS MAY HAVE DIVERGED -- a pause that never
# self-clears. One second later an authenticated usage poll returned 200. The
# credentials were fine; the machine had simply been asleep through the refresh
# window. A human was told to go and revisit the copy-token architecture over a
# fault that did not exist (filed separately as 20260917-110321-ff63).
#
# THE REPORT'S OWN DIAGNOSIS IS WRONG, and the correction matters for anyone
# reading it: it blames `fleet-govern.pl`'s `suspend_gap()` for never firing.
# That file belongs to the FILING PROJECT's own fleet, not to ccpraxis, and
# `fleet-orchestrator.pl:405` does call it. ccpraxis has no `fleet-govern.pl`
# and no `suspend_gap` anywhere; `bp-govern.pl` has no suspend detection at all.
# So the defect is not a wired-up detector failing to fire -- it is that butler's
# orchestrator, alone among the long-lived loops on this machine, never had one.
#
# The idiom is NOT invented here. `plugins/sandbox/container/heartbeat.sh:31`
# already carries `SUSPEND_SLACK=120` -- "a tick overshooting TICK by this much
# means the world was suspended, not that the manager died" -- and uses it to
# stop reaping a container whose host merely slept. Same rule, same threshold,
# second caller. No monotonic clock is needed and none is portable here: the
# INTENDED sleep is the reference, and a tick that took three hours when it asked
# for ten seconds did not take three hours of work.

# --- COORDINATOR DEATH EVIDENCE (report 20260917-155539-b6bf).
#
# 436 watchdog relaunches across two days recorded exit_reason "unknown" -- which
# is what terminal_verdict returns whenever the last jsonl line is not a `result`
# object, i.e. whenever the process was killed mid-stream. The report's summary:
# "436 deaths produce 436 identical log lines with no distinguishing information,
# and a reader has no way to tell one cause from another. A defect that recurs
# 436 times and leaves no evidence is one that cannot be fixed, only absorbed."
#
# The transcripts existed the whole time; nothing looked at them when a session
# died. This does, through the SAME bounded tail reader b29 already uses -- one
# rule, two callers, and no second implementation that could slurp a multi-GB
# stream into the orchestrator's hot loop.
#
# SHAPE, NOT CONTENT. Coordinator transcripts contain prompts. This records the
# sequence of event types, the tool NAMES in the tail, and any error string the
# CLI itself emitted -- enough to tell "died mid-Bash" from "died waiting on a
# dispatched Agent" from "died right after an API error", and not enough to copy
# anybody's prompt into a log.
#
# The report's items 1 and 3 -- the real exit status, and a per-package death cap
# -- are NOT here. Recording the exit status means restructuring bp-launch.sh's
# detached launch, which changes what `$!` records and therefore what the
# liveness and kill paths target; that belongs in a package with a spec and a
# red-team, not in a forensic read. (The report asks for waitpid, which cannot
# work at all: bp-launch.sh runs `setsid nohup claude ... &` inside a subshell
# that exits immediately, so the coordinator is reparented and no ancestor has a
# wait status to collect.)

# The OLD id, `substr(sprintf('%x%x', created_at, $$), 0, 10)`, silently
# discarded almost all of the pid: hex(epoch) alone is 8 hex chars, so the
# 10-char substr left room for only 2 hex digits of pid. Two escalations for
# the SAME package filed within the SAME second -- whether by the same
# process twice, or by two processes whose pids share their low 2 hex digits
# (e.g. 12345 and 12346, or any pid pair congruent mod 256) -- produced the
# IDENTICAL filename. Because the id *is* the filename, the second write's
# rename() clobbered the first with no error and no warning: a real
# escalation simply ceased to exist. e03's own provenance design (a deleted
# id with no archive entry means a human answered it) depends entirely on an
# id genuinely naming ONE escalation -- a collision breaks that invariant
# silently, which is worse than a blocked run.
#
# Merely widening the substr() budget would only make a collision RARER, not
# impossible -- a truncated, finite-width id can always collide given enough
# volume, and "rare" is not the bar for something the provenance/audit trail
# depends on. Two layers, deliberately not one:
#   1. IMPOSSIBLE within a single process: $DECISION_SEQ is monotonic and
#      never reset, so two calls from the SAME process can never produce the
#      same sid regardless of what the epoch/pid portions do -- there is no
#      value of created_at or $$ that can make two DIFFERENT $DECISION_SEQ
#      values collide.
#   2. DETECTED, not silently overwritten, for the residual cross-process
#      case (two different orchestrator/coordinator processes racing to file
#      for the same package in the same second with congruent pid+seq bits):
#      the dedupe scan in queue_needs_you (its own caller, ABOVE this
#      function) already ran and returned early for a legitimate re-file of
#      the same package+kind, so anything this function finds already sitting
#      at its computed path is a GENUINE collision with a different
#      escalation, never a dedupe hit. Retry with a bumped sequence; a
#      persistent collision after a generous bounded retry REFUSES (returns
#      undef) rather than ever renaming over an existing file.

# fixbatch step7 / LOW: $rec->{package} used to be interpolated straight into
# a filesystem path with no sanitization at all -- pre-existing (confirmed by
# `git show 0984fa2`, not introduced by e03), but e03's own
# _bump_chronic_scoping_counter (bp-resolve.pl) is a genuinely NEW caller of
# BpOrch::queue_needs_you(), which is what made this newly reachable, so it
# is e03's to close here rather than carry forward again. Strips only path
# separators and NUL -- deliberately NOT touching anything else, because

# judge IN-FLIGHT state is kept ON DISK (runs/<kind>/<pkg>.inflight, content = the
# epoch the judge was fired) rather than in orchestrator memory, so it survives an
# orchestrator restart (a judge fired before a crash isn't double-spawned and its
# timeout is still honored) and is observable/testable. judge_inflight returns the
# stored start-epoch (truthy) or undef.
# a01/S4 (spec §3 behaviors 28-30): before WRITING a judge outcome (a judge-starved
# decision + registry counter increments) off a death classification made earlier
# this tick, re-read -- under `runs/<kind>/<pkg>.lock` -- the SAME two signals the
# classification was made from: the inflight marker's epoch and whether a verdict
# file has appeared since. `$classified_epoch` is what judge_inflight() returned
# BEFORE clear_judge_inflight ran (the caller's own `$started`). Used purely as a
# lock+re-read+refuse GATE (mutate returns the state unchanged, same shape as
# _harvest_verdict_still_applies) -- MUST be called before this tick's own
# clear_judge_inflight/clear_judge_verdict, or the re-read would see nothing to
# compare against. Returns 1 if the outcome still applies, 0 if refused (logs a
# write_guard event with reason `judge-state-moved`).
#
# HONEST LIMIT (a01's own MAJOR 5, reasoned not demonstrated): this
# lock is released once THIS function returns. Every side effect the caller then
# performs (kill_pid, clear_judge_inflight, archive_judge_verdict, update_registry_pkg,
# queue_needs_you) runs AFTER the release, so the classic gate-then-act race is
# narrowed (whole-tick -> gate-return-to-act) but not eliminated. Closing it fully
# would mean folding every one of those side effects into this gate's own `mutate`
# (the `queue_needs_you` S2 pattern), which is a substantially larger, riskier change
# than this fix-batch's budget allows without jeopardizing the pinned write-guard-primitive /
# write-guard-sites / write-guard-audit oracle. Left open, and named here rather than only in the fix-batch report, per
# the same "never leave the current shape while comments claim the window is
# closed" instruction that flagged it. Also: this lock excludes nothing else in the
# tree (grepped -- no other writer takes `runs/<kind>/<pkg>.lock`); its value is the
# re-read, not mutual exclusion.
#
# e04 fixbatch step7 / red-team MAJOR: the judge-state gate above proves the JUDGE
# hasn't moved (a fresh inflight epoch, or a verdict landing) -- it says nothing
# about the PACKAGE'S LEDGER STATUS, which every caller's `$st` is a once-per-tick
# snapshot of (`_load_state`, never re-read again this tick). A human running
# `bp-answer-decision.pl` mid-tick can flip that status after the snapshot but
# before this function is reached, and this gate used to let the outcome through
# anyway. When `$expected_status` is supplied, ALSO re-read the ledger's `status:`
# field -- under the ledger's OWN lock, the same lock bp-answer-decision.pl's
# status writes take (`BpWrite::lock_path("$bpdir/packages/$pkg.md")`) -- and
# refuse (reason `ledger-status-moved`) if it no longer matches. Same shape as
# `_harvest_verdict_still_applies`'s status check below: a gate-only guarded_write
# whose `mutate` never rewrites the ledger. This is what closes the terminal-race
# `judge-starved`'s exclusion from `%DECISION_VALIDITY` depends on -- see that
# table's comment above.

    # this comment no longer describes one -- describing a write that hasn't
    # happened here since s04 shipped is exactly the kind of drift this
    # script exists to prevent everywhere else.

    # Until an earlier version of this call existed, an orchestrator that
    # reached run_complete released its marker and exited while registry.json

    # registry.json claiming six running coordinators that had not existed
    # for days.

# harvest verdict's premise on disk has since moved -- (a) status is still 'done'
# and (b) last_updated has not moved past the epoch the judge was fired against
# ($started, captured by the caller BEFORE clear_judge_inflight ran). Uses
# BpWrite::guarded_write purely as a lock+re-read+refuse GATE: `mutate` returns
# the ledger's own bytes unchanged, so the primitive's own "new eq state ->
# unchanged" short-circuit fires and the ledger is never rewritten by this call
# (the real ledger write, if the verdict still applies, happens afterwards via
# the ordinary _set_ledger_status call, itself separately guarded). Returns 1 if
# the verdict still applies, 0 if refused (and reason `verdict-stale` was logged
# as a write_guard event).
#
# HONEST LIMIT (fixbatch step7 / red-team MAJOR 5): same caveat as
# _judge_outcome_still_applies above -- the lock releases when this gate returns,
# and the caller's real side effects (_apply_harvest_findings, _set_ledger_status,
# update_registry_pkg) run after that release. Narrowed, not eliminated; see that
# function's header for the full accounting and why a full close is out of this
