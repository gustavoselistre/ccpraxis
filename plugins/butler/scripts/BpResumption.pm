# BpResumption.pm — WILL ANYTHING ACTUALLY BRING THIS SESSION BACK?
#
# One question, asked by two guards that were answering it separately:
#
#   * guard-subagent-stall.sh + bp-runstate.pl guard a RUN. `pause` records a
#     watcher pid and a deadline; `effective` re-verifies both on every read.
#   * gate-continuity.sh + bp-continuity.pl guard a SESSION. `hold` records a
#     deadline and a pid; the Stop gate re-verifies them.
#
# They guard different SCOPES and should stay separate -- a run outlives a
# session, and a session can be armed with no run. What was duplicated was the
# MECHANISM, and the duplication was not free: the run side had already learned
# two things the session side had not, and rediscovering them cost a fix batch.
#
# LESSON ONE: kill(0) IS NOT LIVENESS ON WINDOWS. Perl cannot signal a native
# process it did not create and reports a healthy one as dead. A watcher that
# cannot be verified must not hold a gate open, so the fallback asks tasklist.
#
# LESSON TWO, AND THE ONE THAT MATTERS MOST HERE: A LIVE PID IS NOT THE SAME
# PID. `hold` and `bp-watch.pl` both EXIT when their wait ends -- that is their
# whole purpose -- and the OS is then free to hand that number to anything. A
# bare liveness check cannot tell the difference. The run side's red-team
# demonstrated it concretely: an unrelated `sleep &` occupying the recorded pid
# made a pause read as verified with nothing watching. The session side shipped
# with exactly that hole: kill a hold early and its deadline is still in the
# future, so a recycled pid would satisfy the gate.
#
# So identity is pinned by a FINGERPRINT captured when the promise is made and
# re-derived when it is checked -- a value the OS assigns once at process
# creation and never touches again. undef means "could not be determined", and
# every caller MUST treat that as UNVERIFIED rather than as a match.
#
# The gate is bash and this is perl. Rather than translate the rules a second
# time and re-open the parity gap this module exists to close, the gate shells
# out to bp-resumption.pl. One implementation, one place to fix.
