# bp-judge.pl — the DETERMINISTIC decision core for A5 (the judges). The judges
# themselves are scoped, throwaway `claude -p` calls the orchestrator fires (the
# only Claude in the whole run besides the coordinators); THIS file holds none of
# that — it is the pure, unit-tested logic that decides *whether* to fire a judge,
# *what* to do with its verdict, and *how* a harvest knob reshapes the DAG. The
# orchestrator (bp-orchestrator.pl) is the thin shell that spawns the judges and
# feeds their on-disk verdicts back through these functions.
#
# Two judges (Decisions #13/#15), both fresh-context, both verdict-on-disk:
#   • harvest-judge — verifies a FINISHED package's declared outputs against its
#     done-criteria from disk → pass | fail. Default runs as an async spot-audit
#     (#15); configurably as a per-launch gate.
#   • resolve-judge — a deeper, broad-context attempt to fix a STUCK package
#     (re-scope, corrected relaunch, drop an *optional* criterion) → relaunch | park.
#
# DESIGN: every decision here is a PURE function — no I/O, no globals, no clock —
# so t/judge-decision-core.t can exhaust the matrix without a real `claude`. Verdict parsing
# is fail-CLOSED (an unrecognized judge verdict never reads as "all good": a bad
# harvest verdict escalates, a bad resolve verdict parks — Decision #29's spirit
# applied to the judges' own output).
