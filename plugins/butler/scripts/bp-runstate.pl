# bp-runstate.pl — the run-state machine behind the stop gate.
#
# WHY IT IS A STATE MACHINE AND NOT A DETECTOR
#
# The first two attempts at this gate both asked "does anything look wrong?" —
# first "did a Bash command mention a guard token", then "does the closing
# prose promise work". Both are detectors, and a detector is only as good as
# its guesses: the token version accepted a guard that died on launch, and the
# prose version can be sidestepped by rephrasing a sentence.
#
# This inverts the default. The gate is INERT until a run actually starts, and
# once active the turn may not end until the agent RESOLVES it — explicitly,
# with a verb, in one of exactly two ways:
#
#   finish  — the run is over. Nothing pending. Back to inert.
#   pause   — the run continues, but something else will wake it. Requires a
#             LIVE watcher (real pid + future deadline), which the gate
#             verifies rather than takes on trust.
#
# There is no third way and no "looks fine to me". Silence is not a resolution.
#
# STATES
#   (absent)  inert   — no run. Stopping is always allowed.
#   active            — work is underway. Stopping is DENIED.
#   paused            — resolved temporarily; a verified watcher will resume it.
#                       Stopping is allowed WHILE the watcher is alive; once it
#                       dies or its deadline passes the pause is stale and the
#                       state reverts to active on the next read.
#   finished          — resolved permanently. Stopping is allowed.
#
# ACTIVATION IS NOT A THING THE AGENT MUST REMEMBER. The hook activates on the
# observable fact that a run started: a background subagent dispatch, or a
# director tick that returned run-package. Anything the agent must remember to
# do is a thing it will eventually forget — that is the whole reason this file
# exists.
#
# SCOPE. Project-level, not session-level: "a run" is a property of the
# project. drive-solo is explicitly one interactive session, so the simpler
# scope is the correct one here. Two concurrent drive sessions in one project
# would share this state; that is out of contract for drive-solo.

    #
    # Everything above verifies that a pause is WELL-FORMED: the watcher pid is
    # running, its identity is fingerprinted, the deadline is in the future.
    # None of it establishes that any WORK is in flight. A backgrounded sleep
    # loop armed solely to satisfy the gate passes every check, and a turn that
    # ends with every dispatched agent already finished and nothing new
    # dispatched is then permitted -- with nothing scheduled to wake the
    # session. That is the very failure the gate's own message describes; the
    # gate prevented the unresolved version and allowed a well-formed empty one.
    #
    # THIS WARNS. IT DOES NOT BLOCK, and the report itself argued for that: the
    # hook cannot see the harness's agent table, so any attempt to prove work is
    # pending would be a guess, and a wrong guess here blocks a CORRECT run --
    # strictly worse than the gap it closes (done-criterion 4). A warning costs
    # nothing when wrong and is visible in the transcript at the exact moment
    # the driver can still fix it.
    #
    # WHAT IT CAN HONESTLY CHECK is the one thing the caller alone knows: what
    # the watcher is waiting FOR. `--watching` is that declaration. An absent or
    # timer-shaped one is the signature of a pause armed for the gate rather
    # than for the work, and it is recorded in the state so a later reader --
    # and the gate's own stale-pause message -- can say so rather than
    # rediscovering it.
    #
    # A self-declaration is weaker evidence than an observation, and calling it
    # anything else would repeat the mistake the FIRST version of the stall
    # guard made (it accepted a Bash command that merely CONTAINED a token,
    # verifying ceremony rather than function). The difference is that this one
    # does not gate on the answer: nothing is permitted or refused because of
    # it, so there is nothing for a ceremony to buy.
