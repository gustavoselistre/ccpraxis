# bp-progress.pl — b11-progress-heuristic-turns-backstop: a semantic liveness check
# for a coordinator, returning one of progressing | looping | stuck, each with a
# one-line reason.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (spec §0): the two existing signals are the wrong shape.
# BpOrch::progress_verdict measures stream-log BYTE GROWTH — a coordinator firing
# the same command in a loop produces MORE bytes than one thinking carefully, so
# the runaway reads as maximally healthy. BpOrch::snapshot_progressed counts ledger
# checkbox/status changes — a coordinator can do forty turns of genuine work inside
# one pipeline step and register zero progress under that signal. Measured on this
# run: 12 of 27 packages hit error_max_turns at least once; the turn cap was the
# PRIMARY control loop, not a backstop.
#
# THE ASYMMETRY (spec §2 — read twice, it is the opposite of the obvious guess):
# killing a healthy coordinator is far more expensive than letting a looper run one
# more turn. A wrongly-killed coordinator loses its in-flight work AND pays a full
# context re-ingest at cache-WRITE rates on relaunch (cache read+write is 89% of
# measured fleet cost); a looper that survives one extra cadence costs one cadence
# of tokens. So UNCERTAINTY MUST RETURN "progressing" — never looping/stuck. Every
# ambiguous input (unparseable transcript, absent transcript, empty tail,
# unavailable/misconfigured model, an already-held concurrency lock, an internal
# error) resolves to "progressing" with a stated reason and defers to the turn cap.
# This is the OPPOSITE direction from b41-cache-state-tracking's uncertainty-biases-
# cold: there a missed warm resume was the expensive error; here a wrongful kill is.
# Both packages state their direction because "fail safe" is not a fixed direction —
# it is "fail toward the cheaper mistake", and that depends on the decision.
#
# LAYERING (spec §1): hook first (b10's mechanical repeat guard, zero tokens, acts
# at the repeat) -> semantic check second (THIS script, catches varied commands
# going nowhere) -> turn cap last (a backstop, not the control loop). looping/stuck
# act IMMEDIATELY rather than waiting for the cap; reaching the cap anyway means
# THE HEURISTIC FAILED — a distinct, logged condition about the guard, never queued
# as a package failure (b09 drew the same line for judges; this is the coordinator
# equivalent).
#
# TAIL ONLY: transcripts here reach 10,351,554 bytes (b41's measurement). This
# script NEVER slurps one. It reuses BpOrch::_tail_jsonl_objs (bp-orchestrator.pl),
# itself built on _last_nonempty_line's seek-from-end discipline — a second reader
# is the exact divergence this blueprint keeps paying for, so none is written here.
#
# THROTTLED + NEVER-CONCURRENT: the check costs tokens (a model reads the tail), so
# it runs on a cadence (runs/<pkg>.progress-state.json remembers the last verdict)
# and never twice at once for the same package (an atomic O_EXCL lock file at
# runs/<pkg>.progress.lock — a lock already held defers to "progressing" for that
# tick rather than blocking or guessing).
#
# MODEL SEAM: BP_PROGRESS_MODEL_CMD names a shell command. This script writes the
# JSON-encoded transcript tail (an array of decoded jsonl objects) to the command's
# stdin and reads back exactly one "VERDICT\tREASON" line from its stdout. Unset,
# non-executing, or malformed-output all count as the model being UNAVAILABLE, which
# is itself one of the uncertain cases above (-> progressing). NO network, no real
# model call — this seam is what lets the oracle run offline and deterministically.
#
# CLI:
#   bp-progress.pl verdict <bp> <pkg> [--now=EPOCH] [--repeat-flagged=0|1]
#   bp-progress.pl capped  <bp> <pkg> [--now=EPOCH]
#
# <bp>/<pkg> resolve exactly like bp-cache-state.pl's own convention (itself
# mirroring bp-lib.sh's bp_dir/bp_ledger layout):
#   $CCPRAXIS_DATA_DIR/blueprints/<bp>/{packages/<pkg>.md, runs/<pkg>.jsonl,
#                                        runs/registry.json}
#
# `verdict` NEVER dies and ALWAYS exits 0 — classifying is this script's entire
# job, so even a maximally broken input must still produce a verdict line.
#
# `capped` logs a DISTINCT condition (type containing "heuristic") to
# runs/orchestrator.log via the house BpLog::event logger (bp-log.pl, already
# required transitively through bp-orchestrator.pl below) and never touches the
# package's ledger or registry.json — reaching the cap is a signal about the
# guard, not a package failure (spec §2/§3 C7).
