# bp-jail.pl — per-dispatch worker jail isolation (b33-worker-jail-isolation).
#
# Implements plugins/butler/tests/../specs/b33-worker-jail-isolation-spec.md.
# Creates a chroot-based jail on overlayfs (never /project — modes are not honoured
# there, see spec section 2), populates it with the CURRENT working state of a
# project (git ls-files -z --cached --others --exclude-standard, run OUTSIDE the
# jail — spec section 3.1, decided: NOT git worktree), runs an arbitrary command
# inside it as a non-zero uid with an empty capability set (chroot --userspec),
# reconciles the write set back out on merge (spec section 3.3), and tears down —
# on every exit path, including signals (spec section 3, item 5).
#
# CLI:
#   bp-jail.pl create   --package <pkg> [--jail-root DIR]
#   bp-jail.pl run      --package <pkg> [--jail-root DIR] -- <cmd> [args...]
#   bp-jail.pl merge    --package <pkg> [--jail-root DIR]
#   bp-jail.pl teardown --package <pkg> [--jail-root DIR]
#
# Env (create/merge): BP_PROJECT_ROOT (coordinator-side project root to populate
# from / merge back into), BP_WRITE_SET (colon-separated path-prefix list, same
# dialect as BpOrch::write_sets_overlap — mirrored below, not reimplemented as a
# third dialect; see bp-drive-next.pl for the precedent of mirroring this sub).
#
# Exit codes: 0 ok · 2 usage · 3 precondition not met (missing cap, wrong
# filesystem) · 4 I/O · 5 jailed command exited non-zero · 6 merge-back refused.

# --- b36: environment scrubbing at the jail boundary.
#
# The chroot isolates the FILESYSTEM. That is how b33 keeps the Claude credential away
# from a jailed worker: `claude-home/.credentials.json` is simply unreachable on disk
# (t/worker-jail-isolation.t C1 asserts exactly that). It does NOT isolate
# the ENVIRONMENT — exec() inherits the parent's %ENV wholesale, and nothing in
# this file has ever touched %ENV except to READ BP_PROJECT_ROOT/BP_WRITE_SET.
#
# That was harmless while b33's verified premise held: OpenCode needed no credential, so
# there was no OpenCode secret anywhere to inherit. b36 breaks that premise. It puts a
# whole-session opencode.ai browser cookie into the coordinator's environment, and a
# coordinator that polls spend and then dispatches a jailed worker would hand the cookie
# through verbatim. Spend polling is a coordinator concern; a worker never needs it.
#
# ⚠ This is a DENYLIST, and a denylist does not generalise: the next secret added to a
# coordinator's environment leaks by default, because the default here is "inherit". The
# general fix is an ALLOWLIST at this boundary. That changes what every existing worker
# can see — real blast radius across every package — so it is a design decision that is
# ESCALATED to the operator, not taken here. See the b36 ledger.

# ===========================================================================
# b48 — SUPERSEDED, and the original reasoning below is preserved because it is
# still half right. Read both.
#
# The argument below rejects an allowlist on the grounds that dropping
# controls-delivered-as-environment is a PRIVILEGE INCREASE. That is correct and
# it still governs. What it gets wrong is treating "allowlist" as necessarily
# MINIMAL — it compares a six-variable allowlist against the denylist and finds
# the allowlist wanting. That is a false dichotomy: the protective controls are
# already enumerated in @JAIL_ENV_REQUIRED below, and an allowlist that NAMES
# them defends both directions at once.
#
# What the denylist could never defend, and what forced this change: it leaks
# every variable nobody thought to name. Concretely, inherited today —
#
#   PERL5OPT      arbitrary code into EVERY perl process, and this toolchain is
#                 entirely Perl. This alone is decisive.
#   PERL5LIB      module search path hijack, same reach.
#   LD_PRELOAD    arbitrary code into every dynamically-linked binary.
#   NODE_OPTIONS  --require injection into any node process.
#   GIT_CONFIG_*  GIT_SSH_COMMAND was denied by name; the rest of the family
#                 was not, and GIT_CONFIG_COUNT/KEY/VALUE reconstruct it.
#
# A denylist cannot be completed: every entry is a name someone remembered. The
# allowlist inverts the default so an unnamed variable is absent BY
# CONSTRUCTION, which is the only property that survives the next unknown
# vector.
#
# FAIL DIRECTION, the deciding argument. Getting the allowlist wrong breaks the
# jail — loudly, immediately, and visibly. Getting the denylist wrong grants a
# capability silently and forever. Fail-closed-and-visible beats
# fail-open-and-invisible.
#
# THE DENYLIST IS KEPT and still applied, as a final subtractive pass after the
# allowlist. Belt and braces: if a secret ever acquires an allowed prefix (a
# BP_-named credential, say), it is still removed. Nothing that C13 asserted
# stops being true.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ORIGINAL RATIONALE (b33), retained verbatim:
#
# WHY A DENYLIST AND NOT AN ALLOWLIST — the question was asked directly and the
# obvious answer is wrong.
#
# An allowlist looks safer: a jailed worker READS only six variables
# (BP_DIR, BP_LEDGER, BP_PACKAGE, BP_PROJECT_ROOT, BP_WRITE_SET, PATH) out of
# ~47 inherited, so dropping the other 41 sounds like pure gain.
#
# It is not. Several of those 41 are SECURITY CONTROLS DELIVERED AS ENVIRONMENT,
# and dropping them does not merely break features — it removes protections and
# grants capabilities:
#
#   npm_config_ignore_scripts=true      dropping it RE-ENABLES npm postinstall
#                                       arbitrary code execution
#   DISABLE_UPGRADE_COMMAND=1           }  dropping these RE-ENABLES those
#   DISABLE_INSTALL_GITHUB_APP_COMMAND=1}  commands inside a jailed worker —
#   DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1               }  a privilege INCREASE
#   IS_SANDBOX=1 / CLAUDE_SANDBOX=1        code branches on these; without them
#                                          a worker may behave as if on a host
#   PNPM_CONFIG_MINIMUM_RELEASE_AGE        the >=7-day supply-chain rule
#
# So the threat model is BIDIRECTIONAL: secrets must not leak IN, and controls
# must not fall OUT. An allowlist defends only the first and actively breaks the
# second. The denylist defends the first, and t/worker-jail-isolation.t's
# C13 asserts the second by checking the protective variables are still
# PRESENT inside the jail.
#
# GIT_SSH_COMMAND is denied because it is `ssh -i <deploy-key-path> …`, and b33
# rules that jailed workers get NO git — nothing in the jail needs it. The two
# API-key names are denied pre-emptively: neither is set today, so this costs
# nothing now and prevents a future export from leaking silently.
