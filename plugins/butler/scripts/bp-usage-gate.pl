# bp-usage-gate.pl — ONE host-safe usage-headroom poll for /butler:drive-solo.
#
# drive-solo runs in an interactive session that shares the user's OAuth
# token + usage. There is no deterministic orchestrator to govern it, so the
# drive-solo director (bp-drive-next.pl) governs the session ITSELF: before each
# heavy step it calls this gate (`bp-usage-gate.pl verdict`), and if the gate says
# PAUSE the session sleeps token-cheaply until the window resets, then resumes.
# This is the in-session analogue of the fleet's usage governance (Decisions
# #7-#9) — deliberately simpler, because a single CLI invocation has only ONE
# usage sample and so cannot compute a burn rate. Instead of the fleet's
# burn*drain trip projection, we pause at a fixed SOFT ceiling set BELOW the
# fleet's hard walls (5h 85% / 7d 90%). The headroom between the soft ceiling and
# the hard wall is the reserve that keeps the tiny wake-up checks themselves from
# ever hitting the wall — the whole reason to stop early.
#
# Reuses the vetted transport + parsing the orchestrator already ships:
#   bp-govern.pl  -> BpGovern::iso_to_epoch (resets_at ISO-8601 -> epoch)
#   bp-http.pl    -> BpHttp::request         (curl transport; host Schannel TLS)
# Credentials + endpoint + headers mirror bp-orchestrator.pl::fetch_usage exactly.
#
# CRITICAL (host/Windows): this perl spawns curl (a native win32 binary) with a
# URL and header values that contain ':'. Git-for-Windows MSYS2 would mangle those
# ':'-bearing args (PATH-style translation, re-joined with ';') and corrupt the
# request. Disable MSYS2 arg conversion for this whole process (per CLAUDE.md).

    # This used to return until_epoch => undef, which every consumer reads as a
    # hard-stop relogin park: the run halted and stayed halted until a human
    # noticed and re-authenticated. That was wrong in the common case. The
    # access token is refreshed for us (Claude Code holds a refreshToken); the
    # floor exists to avoid starting work that would die MID-FLIGHT, not to
    # demand human intervention.
    #
    # So the pause now carries a wake time — expiry plus a grace margin, by
    # which point the refresh has happened — and a consumer that waits can
    # continue without anyone being asked to do anything.
    #
    # KNOW WHAT CONSUMES THIS, because it is not what an earlier version of this
    # comment claimed. `bp-drive-next.pl` is the ONLY caller of this script; the

    # through `bp-token-keeper.pl` instead. And drive-next no longer waits on
    # pause-token: it attempts a refresh and either continues or stops.
    #
    # So `until_epoch` currently has NO consumer that sleeps on it. It is
    # emitted because it is true and cheap, and because a future waiting
    # consumer should not have to re-derive it — not because anything waits
    # today. Do not write "the fleet resumes by itself" on the strength of this

    #
    # The usage endpoint is a SHARED, RATE-LIMITED resource that a live
    # orchestrator depends on every ~63 seconds. On 2026-09-16 a reporter ran
    # this gate four times in about ten seconds to sanity-check a surprising
    # reading; the fourth returned 429. The orchestrator's next three polls --
    # 23:50:14, 23:51:17, 23:52:18 -- all got 429, and it wrote
    # runs/.paused {"reason":"telemetry"} at 23:52:18, halting every new package
    # launch for about three minutes.
    #
    # The sharp part of that report is that two pieces of existing guidance
    # ACTIVELY CONFLICT: a package's own Inputs section says usage.pl "has been
    # seen to return inconsistent readings (40 -> 44 -> 40 -> 51 -> 40 on one
    # steady run), so read it more than once before deciding" -- and doing
    # exactly that is what tripped the limit and paused the fleet.
    #
    # So repeated reads stop costing anything. A successful reading is cached
    # for slightly less than the orchestrator's own poll interval; a caller
    # reading four times in ten seconds now makes ONE request. Correctness is
    # unaffected: the gate compares percentages against soft ceilings inside a
    # five-hour and a seven-day window, where a sub-minute-old sample and a
    # fresh one cannot differ enough to change a verdict.
    #
    # NOT the orchestrator's poll. bp-orchestrator.pl::fetch_usage is a separate
    # code path and is deliberately left alone -- it is the process entitled to a
    # fresh sample on its own cadence, and this cache exists to protect it from
    # everyone else.
    #
    # ONLY 200s are cached. A 429 or a 5xx must never become sticky: caching a
