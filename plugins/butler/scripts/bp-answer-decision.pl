# bp-answer-decision.pl — the MECHANICAL unblock the reporter performs once a
# human has answered a queued runs/needs-you/ decision (A7). The reporter (Claude)
# decides *what* the answer is (intent — talking to the human, choosing the
# action, writing the corrective note); THIS does the deterministic, atomic file
# surgery that actually unblocks the run, so that load-bearing step is unit-tested
# rather than improvised in prose (house rule: deterministic enforcement, not a
# skill body, for mechanical state changes).
#
# Two families of decision, distinguished by `kind` (the schema A3/A5 queue):
#   • package park — stuck-package | harvest-failure | harvest-spawn-failure:
#       relaunch (default) -> append the human's note to the ledger as a
#                             "## Human decision" corrective section, set ledger
#                             status -> pending, reset the registry (attempt 0,
#                             status pending) so the orchestrator relaunches it
#                             next tick with a fresh budget (_load_state is
#                             ledger-first, re-read every tick).
#       reset              -> like relaunch, but ALSO resets the resolve budget and
#                             SUPERSEDES any in-flight coordinator/judge for the
#                             package (kills it + clears its markers) — for a
#                             package wedged at the cap or mid-resolve the human
#                             wants to retry from scratch (#29).
#       accept             -> ledger status -> done (accept the output as-is; no
#                             relaunch — e.g. a harvest the human judges fine).
#       drop               -> ledger status -> dropped (abandon the package).
#   • fleet pause — reauth | contract-drift:
#       resume (default)   -> clear runs/.paused (the human did the external
#                             action: /login, or inspected the drift); the
#                             orchestrator resumes next tick.
# Decision mode DELETES the answered queue file; direct --package mode clears every
# queued decision for that package (a reset has no single decision id to consume).
#
# DIRECT PACKAGE MODE (#29): bp-answer-decision.pl <bp> --package <pkg> [--action
# reset] resets/relaunches a package that has NO queued decision (e.g. it just hit
# the attempt cap and the orchestrator fired a resolve-judge). It does the same
# atomic surgery a human would otherwise hand-craft — no manual registry edits,
# process-killing, or marker-clearing. The orchestrator (left running) relaunches
# the package fresh on its next tick.
#
# DESIGN: plan_answer() is a PURE function (kind+action -> the plan) so t/13 can
# exhaust the matrix; the CLI does the I/O, reusing bp-orchestrator.pl's already-
# tested atomic writers (no duplicated, drift-prone frontmatter/registry logic).
#
# CLI: bp-answer-decision.pl <blueprint> --decision <id|file|path>

#
# b17-answer-decision-completeness fixes four defects (see the spec of that name):
#   1. `--action reset` now CLEARS the package's registry `session_id` (plan_answer's
#      `clear_session`), so bp-resume-sweep.sh's "gap > 60m OR no session id" rule
#      classifies the next launch COLD. Plain `relaunch` does NOT touch session_id —
#      these are deliberately opposite levers (a human who wants a genuinely fresh
#      coordinator context asks for reset, not relaunch).
#   2. `--widen-write-set PATH` ADDS a path to the package ledger's write_set
#      frontmatter field, additively, going through bp-ledger.pl's own byte-level
#      splice/validate/atomic-write engine (run_op) rather than a second, independent
#      frontmatter writer of this script's own. `--set-write-set` (full replacement)
#      is always refused with a named cause — see the module doc below for why this
#      is NOT the same move as rewriting `mandated_means`.
#   3. Every kind bp-orchestrator.pl's own producers can queue routes to a
#      deterministic outcome; `known_kinds()` DERIVES that list by parsing
#      bp-orchestrator.pl's source with the exact same regexes t/69's oracle uses, so
#      it cannot hand-drift as b01/b09/b11/b16 add more kinds. An unrecognised kind
#      fails loudly (named in the message) and changes nothing.
#   4. `--note` now persists on EVERY action (relaunch/reset/accept/drop) — the
#      `if $plan->{relaunch}` gate that silently dropped it for accept/drop is gone.

#
# BROAD WRITE, NARROW CLEAR. Eight scripts write into runs/needs-you/ --
# bp-answer-decision.pl, bp-contract.pl, bp-judge.pl, bp-orchestrator.pl,
# bp-resolve.pl, bp-shape-lint.pl, bp-token-keeper.pl, bp-wait-for-decision.pl
# -- and until now exactly ONE path cleared anything: clear_pkg_decisions
# above, and only for a DIRECT package reset. A package that simply finished,
# or a run that simply ended, left its question queued forever.
#
# THE SETTLE RULE IS DUPLICATED FROM RunState::decision_live, ON PURPOSE, and
# t/95's parity check pins the two together so drift is caught rather than
# assumed away. It is the same technique statusline.pl already uses for
# bp_continuity_active_dir ("Path resolution is duplicated ... ON PURPOSE --
# this file stays a standalone installed payload"; AC-13 pins the parity). The
# alternative was a butler script requiring a sandbox module, which is a
# dependency this tree does not have in either direction.
#
# WHY THE READER FILTERS *AND* THIS SWEEPS. The reader alone would make the
# count right while the files accumulated forever. This sweep alone would never
# reach the operator's case at all: their run had ENDED, so nothing was ticking
# to run it -- the same trap package t02 found with spend, where the only
# writer was a fleet orchestrator an interactive session never starts. Both
# halves are needed, and neither is redundant.
