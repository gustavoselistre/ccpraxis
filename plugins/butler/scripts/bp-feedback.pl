# bp-feedback.pl — one-command capture of a single piece of operator feedback
# (b25-feedback-intake, R-06).
#
# An agent mid-task fires this, gets one line of output (the path it wrote),
# and returns to what it was doing. It writes exactly one new file per
# invocation, feedback-<n>.txt, into the current batch under
# <data>/corrections/, with a small provenance header, and exits.
#
# It does NOT: interpret, classify or summarise the text; prompt or open an
# editor; run a sub-task; edit any existing file; open any existing file for
# writing or appending; write into a batch that already has a DECOMPOSED.md
# by default (it opens the next one instead — see _resolve_batch_dir below);
# or read a skill. All of that judgement work belongs to the
# feedback skill (plugins/butler/skills/feedback/), not to this CLI.
#
# Usage:
#   bp-feedback.pl [options] [--] [text ...]
# See _usage() below for the option list. Text is taken from the positional
# arguments if any are given, else read from stdin to EOF. Never detects
# whether stdin is an interactive terminal — that would hang the moment an
# agent fires this with nothing piped in and nothing typed.
#
# Exit codes: 0 captured (also --help); 1 usage error; 2 no content;
# 3 control-byte refusal; 4 filesystem/path error; 5 invalid UTF-8.
# Every diagnostic goes to STDERR, prefixed "bp-feedback: ".

  --source <token>     override the source token (default "chat", or
                       "transcript" when --from-session supplied the body)
  --from-session <id>  take the body from that session's transcript instead of
                       argv/stdin, so the operator's bytes are never retyped by
                       an agent. Pair with --command to lift the exact
                       <command-args> payload of a slash-command invocation.
  --command <name>     with --from-session: the slash command whose arguments
                       are the feedback (e.g. butler:feedback). Without it, the
                       last plainly-typed user message is used.
  --blueprint <name>   record this blueprint name; overrides detection
  --batch <name>       target batch directory name
                       (default: the newest OPEN batch, i.e. one with no
                        DECOMPOSED.md; if the newest batch is closed, or
                        there are none, a new batch-<max+1> is created and
                        used)
  --data-dir <path>    override <data> resolution
  -h, --help           print usage to STDOUT and exit 0

Reads the feedback body from the positional arguments if any are given,
otherwise from stdin (read to EOF, in binary). Captures verbatim, byte for
byte; interprets nothing.

When piping into this tool, prefer `set -o pipefail` in the calling shell: a
producer that dies mid-pipe closes stdin early, which this tool cannot
distinguish from a short, complete message, and pipefail is what surfaces
the producer's own exit code to the caller.
