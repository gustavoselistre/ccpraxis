#!/usr/bin/env perl
# bp-lifecycle.pl — reconcile a blueprint's recorded run-state with what is
# actually on disk, and archive it once it is done.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOW
#
# On every observation of a dead (non-live) blueprint it:
#
#   1. removes a stale `runs/.orchestrator` marker (one whose pid is no
#      longer alive, or holds no usable pid at all);
#   2. clears a TERMINAL package's leftover `pid` from its `runs/registry.json`
#      entry — this is the only place left that clears that pid
#      (bp-orchestrator.pl names this script "the only clearer" of it; a
#      reused pid would otherwise make `bp-status.sh` draw a dead run as
#      live);
#   3. archives the blueprint (moves it into `blueprints/_archive/`) once its
#      lifecycle derives `done` (see `BpState::blueprint_lifecycle`), unless
#      `--no-archive` was given.
#
# It does NOT repair blueprint.md's package-status TABLE, and it does NOT
# reconcile a `runs/registry.json` entry's `status` field — both were retired
# by s05-retire-reconciler-drift-paths (2026-08-14): the table's writer
# (`bp-blueprint.pl`'s `set-status` verb) was hard-retired by s03, and no
# in-scope reader ever consults a registry entry's `status` key any more
# (only the ledgers are). This script previously also repaired those two
# copies of package status; see this blueprint's Harvest log for why that
# became impossible (the 2026-07-28 table-drift incident that motivated the
# original four-copies design is recorded there, not here).
#
# THE RULE THIS SCRIPT ENFORCES
#
#   The ledgers are the truth. Everything else observed here is derived, and
#   is repaired to match on every observation.
#
# SAFETY
#
# A LIVE run owns its own state. When `runs/.orchestrator` exists AND its pid is
# alive, this script reports what it sees and changes NOTHING — racing the
# orchestrator for registry.json would be a far worse bug than the staleness it
# is fixing. Only a dead run is reconciled.
#
# Usage:
#   bp-lifecycle.pl reconcile --blueprint <name|dir> [options]
#   bp-lifecycle.pl reconcile --all                  [options]
#
# Options:
#   --data-dir DIR   blueprints root's parent (default: $CCPRAXIS_DATA_DIR, else
#                    <project-root>/.ccpraxis-local-data)
#   --archive        move a blueprint that reaches `done` into blueprints/_archive/
#   --no-archive     never archive (default is --archive; see ARCHIVING below)
#   --dry-run        report what would change, change nothing
#   --json           machine-readable report on stdout
#   --quiet          suppress the human report (implied by --json)
#
# ARCHIVING is on by default and that is deliberate. The operator's standing
# instruction is that they should not have to ask for a finished blueprint to be
# closed out and filed. Archiving is a MOVE into `_archive/`, never a delete:
# nothing is lost, the blueprint stays readable, and `/blueprint:manage list`
# still names archived ones.
#
# Exit status: 0 on success (including "nothing to do"), 1 on a usage error,
# 2 if any blueprint could not be reconciled.
