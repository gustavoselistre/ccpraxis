#!/usr/bin/env perl
# bp-lifecycle.pl — reconcile a blueprint's recorded run-state with what is
# actually on disk, and archive it once it is done.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOW
#
# On every observation of a dead (non-live) blueprint it:
#
#   1. removes a stale `runs/.orchestrator` marker (one whose pid is no
#      longer alive, or holds no usable pid at all);
#   2. clears a TERMINAL package's leftover `pid` from its `runs/registry.json`
#      entry — this is the only place left that clears that pid
#      (bp-orchestrator.pl names this script "the only clearer" of it; a
#      reused pid would otherwise make `bp-status.sh` draw a dead run as
#      live);
#   3. writes a package's ledger `status: running` back to `pending` when the
#      registry cannot supply a pid for it (no row, or a row with no `pid`
#      key) AND no live process — fleet coordinator or solo driver — can be
#      attributed to it ("orphaned running"; 10-unreapable-running). Only the
#      ledger is written; `runs/registry.json` is never touched by this
#      repair;
#   4. withdraws (never deletes) a queued escalation of a nominated kind
#      whose premise has demonstrably evaporated, gaining `withdrawn_at` /
#      `withdrawn_reason` on the record (10-unreapable-running, criterion 7);
#   5. archives the blueprint (moves it into `blueprints/_archive/`) once its
#      lifecycle derives `done` (see `BpState::blueprint_lifecycle`), unless
#      `--no-archive` was given.
#
# It does NOT repair blueprint.md's package-status TABLE, and it does NOT
# reconcile a `runs/registry.json` entry's `status` field — both were retired
# by s05-retire-reconciler-drift-paths (2026-08-14): the table's writer
# (`bp-blueprint.pl`'s `set-status` verb) was hard-retired by s03, and no
# in-scope reader ever consults a registry entry's `status` key any more
# (only the ledgers are). This script previously also repaired those two
# copies of package status; see this blueprint's Harvest log for why that
# became impossible (the 2026-07-28 table-drift incident that motivated the
# original four-copies design is recorded there, not here).
#
# THE RULE THIS SCRIPT ENFORCES
#
#   The ledgers are the truth. Everything else observed here is derived, and
#   is repaired to match on every observation.
#
# SAFETY
#
# A LIVE run owns its own state. When `runs/.orchestrator` exists AND its pid is
# alive, this script reports what it sees and changes NOTHING — racing the
# orchestrator for registry.json would be a far worse bug than the staleness it
# is fixing. Only a dead run is reconciled.
#
# Usage:
#   bp-lifecycle.pl reconcile --blueprint <name|dir> [options]
#   bp-lifecycle.pl reconcile --all                  [options]
#
# Options:
#   --data-dir DIR   blueprints root's parent (default: $CCPRAXIS_DATA_DIR, else
#                    <project-root>/.ccpraxis-local-data)
#   --archive        move a blueprint that reaches `done` into blueprints/_archive/
#   --no-archive     never archive (default is --archive; see ARCHIVING below)
#   --dry-run        report what would change, change nothing
#   --json           machine-readable report on stdout
#   --quiet          suppress the human report (implied by --json)
#
# ARCHIVING is on by default and that is deliberate. The operator's standing
# instruction is that they should not have to ask for a finished blueprint to be
# closed out and filed. Archiving is a MOVE into `_archive/`, never a delete:
# nothing is lost, the blueprint stays readable, and `/blueprint:manage list`
# still names archived ones.
#
# Exit status: 0 on success, 2 on a usage error or if any blueprint could not
# be reconciled.

    # Every pid artefact this blueprint can carry (runs/.orchestrator,
    # runs/<pkg>.pid, a registry row's `pid`) is written EXCLUSIVELY by
    # tooling that requires the sandbox (bp-launch.sh's bp_require_sandbox
    # gate; drive-solo is sandbox-only by the same convention -- see
    # skills/drive-solo/SKILL.md). `bp-status.sh` is deliberately
    # host-runnable and carries no such gate (its own comment records why:
    # a hard requirement made the whole status surface unusable on the
    # host). `pid_alive` is `kill(0,$pid)` against the CALLER's own pid
    # namespace -- on the host, that is never the namespace that wrote a
    # container pid (project CLAUDE.md: "Crossing them does not error — it
    # answers 'no such process'"). Before this package, that false negative
    # cost a deleted `.orchestrator` marker; after it, the SAME false
    # negative would flip every `running` ledger the new repair touches to
    # `pending`. Refuse repairs 3/4 entirely, rather than risk it, whenever
    # this blueprint carries a pid artefact we cannot trust ourselves to
    # judge: a run only exists in the sandbox, so this loses nothing real.

    # neither has nothing this gate could ever protect, and reporting a
    # `skipped` action anyway would be pure noise indistinguishable from a

    # status never left `drafting`, can never be archived by the normal path --
    # and reconcile said NOTHING about it. It exited 0, reported
    # all_delivered:1, returned an EMPTY action list, and looked exactly like
    # success. That is the expensive half: a future reader sees a finished
    # initiative still listed as live and has no way to know why.
    #
    # `drafting` means "not yet audited". The audit gate belongs to the
    # authoring flow (/blueprint:create runs bp-auditor); a MANUAL drive drives
    # packages, ticks steps and commits, but nothing in that path records an
    # audit or advances this field. So a manually-driven initiative completes
    # perfectly and sits unarchivable forever.
    #
    # WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, and it is the whole reason the fix is a diagnostic
    # rather than a state change: it does not write `audited`. Backdating an
    # audit that never happened is worse than the bug -- the gate exists
    # precisely so nobody can claim one. Done-criterion 3 forbids it outright.
    # It also does not quietly widen the archive condition, which would drop
    # the gate's meaning for every blueprint rather than just this one.
