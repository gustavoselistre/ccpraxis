# bp-checkpoint.pl — durable WIP checkpoint commits (b02, Decisions #2/#17).
#
# One job: stage ONLY a package's declared write-set pathspecs and make a single
# inline WIP commit on the current branch, so a coordinator that dies mid-step
# has its in-flight work recoverable. Never a run-branch, never a push, never a
# squash — those stay a human's call (Decision #2).
#
# Two shapes, one file (the bp-deps-check.pl / bp-orchestrator.pl convention):
#   • module — `require "<dir>/bp-checkpoint.pl"; BpCheckpoint::checkpoint({...})`.
#     The orchestrator calls it IN-PROCESS: no subprocess, no exit-code scraping.
#     `require` has NO top-level side effects (four test files load the
#     orchestrator, which loads this).
#   • CLI    — `perl bp-checkpoint.pl --pkg <p> --write-set <colon-string> ...`,
#     guarded by `unless (caller)`; exit 0/1/2/3 (see the CLI block at the end).
#
# INVARIANTS (each one is an AC in t/durable-checkpoint-commits.t and
# t/checkpoint-hardening.t):
#   • NEVER dies. Every failure — no repo, no git binary, a locked index, a
#     rejecting hook, a hung or signal-killed child — is a structured hashref
#     with a closed `reason` enum.
#   • NEVER stages the whole tree. A write-set entry must begin with a LITERAL
#     path segment; every spelling of "everything" (`*`, `**/*`, `./.`, `?*`,
#     `[a-z]*`, ...) is DROPPED, because such a pathspec stages the entire
#     repository — that is the whole point of the exercise.
#   • NEVER a shell. Every git call is fork + exec of the list
#     ('git', '-C', <root>, ...); the working directory is never changed and no
#     command string is ever interpolated.
#   • NEVER executes repo-local config. `core.fsmonitor` / `core.hooksPath` are
#     pinned per invocation, so a worktree-writable config value can never turn
#     a checkpoint into an arbitrary program run as the orchestrator.
#   • NEVER blocks forever. Every child is read under a deadline and killed on
#     expiry: the orchestrator's watch loop is single-threaded.
#   • NEVER commits off a branch. A detached HEAD or an in-progress rebase /
#     merge / cherry-pick / bisect is a clean no-op, not a commit.
#   • NEVER an AI-authorship trailer on a commit message (house rule).
#

# _git($root, @args) -> ($merged_output, $exit)
#
# fork + exec of a LIST (bp-deps-check.pl:403-423's shape). Load-bearing
# properties, in order of how badly their absence bites:
#
#   • the child's STDERR is MERGED into the captured stream — "fatal: not a git
#     repository" is an EXPECTED outcome here, not something to spray on the
#     orchestrator's console — and that captured text is what `detail` reports.
#   • `core.fsmonitor` and `core.hooksPath` are pinned OFF/back to the in-repo
#     default on every invocation. Both are ordinary repo-local config values
#     naming a program git will execute, and this process runs as the
#     orchestrator, outside the guard-bash policy boundary that gates every
#     coordinator and worker. Pinning them keeps the deliberate "no
#     --no-verify, the repo's own hooks are the human's contract" decision
#     (§2.4) while removing the redirect a worktree-writable config could use.
#   • the child's STDIN is /dev/null. A `pre-commit` hook that reads, or git
#     prompting for a credential or a gpg passphrase, would otherwise inherit
#     the orchestrator's stdin and block on it forever.
#   • the read is bounded by $GIT_TIMEOUT. The watch loop is single-threaded:
#     while it waits here it launches nothing, watches nothing and refreshes no
#     token. The deadline is enforced with a 4-arg select() and NOT with
#     alarm(), so this can never disturb an outstanding alarm or the
#     $SIG{TERM}/$SIG{INT} handling run() installs.
#
# Exit sentinels, never shifted: -1 fork/exec failed · -2 killed by a signal
# (`$? >> 8` would read a SIGKILL as a clean 0 and report a commit that never
# happened) · -3 timed out · 127 git binary missing.

# everywhere else.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY HERE SPECIFICALLY.
#
# This file is loaded by bp-orchestrator.pl, whose BEGIN sets
# MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL='*' — so in that process MSYS argv path-translation is
# OFF. resolve_root()/BpOrch::_project_root_of hand back POSIX paths
# (/c/Users/...), and a POSIX path handed to native git.exe with conversion
# disabled is resolved against the CURRENT DRIVE: git looks for C:\c\Users\...,
# does not find it, and every checkpoint degrades to not-a-repo. That is the
# drive-root landmine the user-global CLAUDE.md documents — the one that left
# 576 stray entries at C:\c\ — and its rule is explicit: opting out of
# conversion is only safe TOGETHER WITH hand-translating your own paths. The
# orchestrator opts out; this is the translation half.
#
# Deliberately NOT the same as bp-preflight.pl's run_git, which only normalises
# backslashes and leans on MSYS auto-translation. That is correct THERE because
# bp-preflight.pl does not disable conversion (its own comment warns against
# doing so). The two differ because their processes differ, not by oversight.
#
# Correct under EITHER conversion state, which is the point: git.exe accepts the
# forward-slash Windows form directly, and MSYS has nothing left to mangle in a
# path that no longer starts with a slash. Mirrors vault-sync.pl's git_path().
