package HostCaps;
# HostCaps -- functional probes for host capabilities the butler oracles assume.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# These oracles were written against the sandbox container: Linux, overlayfs,
# real POSIX signals, jq on PATH, /root writable, and no .ccpraxis-local-data
# anywhere above /tmp. Run the same files on the Windows host and they do not
# report "this cannot be checked here" -- they report FAILURE, or die outright
# and take every later assertion in the file down with them. Both are lies: the
# first says the code is broken when only the environment differs, and the
# second hides however many hundred assertions came after the die.
#
# The rule this module encodes: a capability the host genuinely lacks must
# produce a LOUD SKIP naming the uncovered ground, never a red assertion and
# never a dead file. A skip is honest -- it says "not checked here". A failure
# claims something false, and a die claims nothing at all.
#
# EVERY PROBE IS FUNCTIONAL, NOT DECLARATIVE. Asking `$^O` or "is the sub
# implemented" is exactly how this suite got its worst false signal: perl on
# Windows IMPLEMENTS symlink(), so `eval { symlink(...); 1 }` returns true --
# and then the call fails at runtime anyway. Probes here DO the thing in a
# throwaway directory and check the result.

# --- native_tmp / tempdir_args --------------------------------------------
#
# A temp root that NATIVE Windows binaries can resolve. Several oracles
# `require` bp-orchestrator.pl (or bp-drive-next.pl / bp-usage-gate.pl), whose
# BEGIN block sets MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL='*' -- disabling MSYS argv translation
# for the WHOLE test process from that line on. A bare tempdir() then yields
# /tmp/XXXX; perl resolves it, but `git -C /tmp/XXXX` hands git.exe a POSIX
# path that Windows resolves against the current DRIVE as C:\tmp\XXXX. That is
# the drive-root landmine documented in the user-global CLAUDE.md -- the one
# that left 576 stray entries and prompted steward's t/09.
#
# Opting out of conversion is only safe TOGETHER WITH hand-translating your own
# paths. This is the translation half: anchor in %TEMP%, already a C:/... path,
# so every derived path is correct under EITHER conversion state instead of
# depending on one.

# Splice into a tempdir() call: tempdir(HostCaps::tempdir_args(), CLEANUP => 1)

# scratch_root()'s own subdirectory (formerly %TEMP%, before blueprint
# test-platform-split package 04-scratch-root) makes it a Windows-form path,
# while abs_path() on MSYS always returns POSIX form, so
# `is($got, "$ROOT/x")` starts failing on the path STYLE rather than on the
# behaviour under test. Measured: it silently broke four otherwise-correct
# assertions in t/22. Translate at the call site instead of at the source when
# the path has perl-side readers as well as native ones.

# --- scratch_root ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The SOLE owner of the ccpraxis test-scratch root (blueprint test-platform-
# split, package 04-scratch-root, Decision 6/7). StewardTest.pm and
# TestSandbox.pm do NOT implement this themselves -- they `require HostCaps`
# (bareword, via an __FILE__-derived `use lib`, so every caller lands on the
# identical %INC key and the file loads exactly once) and call
# HostCaps::scratch_root() fully-qualified.
#
# Consolidates three previously-independent scratch bases (HostCaps'
# %TEMP%-anchored tempdir_args, StewardTest's C:/Users/Public, TestSandbox's
# $HOME/.cache/sandbox-tests) into ONE root so a single Windows Defender
# exclusion covers all test scratch, without excluding the whole of %TEMP%
# (drive-by downloads land there) or C:/Users/Public (declined, Decision 10).
#
# Default: C:/ccpraxis-scratch (Decision 7 -- a drive-root ASCII path,
# deliberately, not the untranslated-POSIX-path stray class the user-global
# CLAUDE.md warns about). Overridable via CCPRAXIS_SCRATCH_ROOT for CI, with
# the override VALIDATED (absolute, exists) rather than trusted -- a bad
# override DIES rather than silently falling back, so a broken CI pipeline is
# never masked as "just used the platform default".
#
# NOTE: this is a NEW, separate function. native_tmp()/tempdir_args()'s prior
# behavior and git_path()'s substitution target are NOT touched by this sub --
# see native_tmp()'s own header comment for why it must stay %TEMP%-anchored
# (it is a translation table for MSYS's physical /tmp mount, not a choice of
# scratch root).
#
# MEMOIZED FOR THE LIFE OF THE PROCESS: mutating $ENV{CCPRAXIS_SCRATCH_ROOT}
# after the first call here has no effect -- the first result is cached in
# %cache and handed to every later caller in this process, silently, by
# design (same pattern as native_tmp()'s own cache, above). A caller that
# needs to exercise a second override value must do so in a fresh
# subprocess, not via `local $ENV{CCPRAXIS_SCRATCH_ROOT} = ...` in-process --
# see StewardTest.pm's own header for the identical discipline applied to
# vault-sync.pl's HOME handling, and this package's own oracle
# (scratch-root-single.t's "MEMOIZATION FORCES SUBPROCESSES" note) for the
# concrete pattern.
#
# OVERRIDE VALIDATION (blueprint test-platform-split, Decision 12): the
# override does not sit BESIDE the default root, it BECOMES the root, so it
# inherits the native-path constraint the default root must also satisfy --
# not merely "absolute" in the generic sense. On Windows a bare POSIX-style
# absolute path (a leading '/' with no drive letter) is refused outright: a
# native binary resolves that leading '/' against the CURRENT DRIVE, not a
# POSIX root, which is exactly the shape of the 2026-06-12 576-stray
# incident this whole package exists to prevent (e.g.
# CCPRAXIS_SCRATCH_ROOT=/usr is a real, existing directory on Git-for-Windows
# that maps to C:\Program Files\Git\usr -- passing an "absolute + exists"
# check while landing test scratch inside the Git install tree). Off Windows
# a POSIX absolute path stays correct, since the override is the only way
# scratch_root() returns anything there at all.
#
# The override is also never canonicalized: a '..' segment (or a
# symlink/junction) is refused outright rather than silently resolved --
# consistent with this function's "refuse rather than guess" doctrine
# elsewhere (the relative-path and does-not-exist checks below).

# than ($? & 127), so a "$? >> 8 reads SIGKILL as 0" regression test cannot

#
# almanac 20260823-210122-433f. Four oracles hardcoded
# `.ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-butler-overhaul/...`. That blueprint
# was ARCHIVED -- the documented, expected end of a finished initiative -- and
# every one of them went red, reporting "missing" about a file sitting intact
# 30 characters away under `_archive/`. One of them died outright and took 139
# assertions with it.
#
# ARCHIVING IS NOT BREAKAGE. This is the same shape the predecessor
# initiative's retrospective already named -- an assertion that treats a
# legitimate new state as breakage -- and the report notes it is the third time
# it has been paid for. Resolving through both locations makes archival a
# non-event for the suite, which is what it should have been all along.

# under .ccpraxis-local-data/, which git does not carry, so a FRESH CLONE could
# never pass and the failure would look identical to the archival one. That is
