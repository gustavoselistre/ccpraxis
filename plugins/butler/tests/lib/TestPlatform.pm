# =============================================================================
# TestPlatform.pm -- the per-file platform declaration this repo's tests will
# eventually carry, and the ONE pure module that turns the leading bytes of a
# file's text into one of exactly three distinguishable outcomes: a legal
# platform (legal_values()), `absent` (no marker found anywhere in the
# scanned prefix), or `invalid` (something marker-shaped but not legal).
#
# Nothing else in the tree consults this yet (blueprint test-platform-split,
# package 01-platform-marker): no `.t` gets a marker added (package 02),
# nothing enforces the marker's presence (package 03), and
# scripts/run-tests.pl is not touched (package 06). This module only makes
# the outcomes mechanically available.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY A MARKER AT ALL, AND WHY `absent` MUST NEVER DEFAULT
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# scripts/run-tests.pl classifies container tests by what they IMPORT,
# deliberately, so a new one is classified correctly without anybody
# remembering to mark it. This module instead defines an explicit per-file
# tag, because a test's platform NEED is a human intent no import can stand
# in for -- it has to be declared. The two schemes converge on the same
# property (a classifier that cannot silently go stale) by different
# routes: the import scheme makes forgetting structurally impossible; this
# scheme makes a missing/malformed declaration fail LOUDLY instead of
# quietly defaulting (package 03's job, not this module's). That is why
# `value` is defined if and only if `outcome eq 'legal'` -- a parser that
# ever defaulted `absent` to a platform would make package 03's enforcement
# decorative, which is this package's entire reason for existing (done
# criterion 3).
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE MARKER LINE -- exact syntax, pinned byte-for-byte (spec section 2)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Canonical form: `# platform: windows` (also `linux`, `any`). The STRICT
# pattern below requires lowercase `platform`, tolerates whitespace around
# `platform`/`:` and leading indentation before `#`, and permits only
# trailing whitespace plus an optional `\r` after the captured value.
# Legality of the captured value is decided afterwards by exact string
# membership in legal_values() -- never by the regex itself, and never with
# aliasing/case-folding (`Windows`, `win`, `windows ` are all illegal).
#
# A line that is recognisably TRYING to be a marker -- wrong-case keyword,
# or trailing prose after an otherwise-legal value -- but fails the strict
# pattern is caught by a second, deliberately loose, case-insensitive
# pattern, and reported as `invalid`/`malformed-marker-line` rather than
# collapsed into `absent`. This exists because package 03 must be able to
# name THE FIX in its refusal message (its own done criterion 2), and "no
# marker -- add one" is a wrong fix for a file that already has a
# marker-shaped line on screen with the wrong case or extra text.
#
# PRECEDENCE IS PREFIX-WIDE, NOT PER-LINE: the loose pattern is consulted
# ONLY when the strict pattern found zero matches anywhere in the bounded
# prefix. A text with one malformed line and one strictly-valid line is
# `legal`, full stop -- the malformed line is not surfaced in that result at
# all. This is what stops a future "improvement" to the loose pattern from
# ever reclassifying a line that already parses.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE PREFIX BOUND -- enforced in TWO places that must agree
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# prefix_bytes() returns 4096, a plain integer. read_prefix() reads at most
# that many bytes from disk (a single bounded read, never a full-file
# slurp, which is what keeps scanning hundreds of files cheap). parse_marker
# INDEPENDENTLY truncates whatever text it is given to
# substr($text, 0, prefix_bytes()) -- byte semantics, no "use utf8" in this
# file -- before applying either pattern. This makes the bound part of
# parse_marker's own pure contract, testable with a plain in-memory string
# and no fixture file on disk.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# ADJUDICATED, NOT FIXED: an in-window marker outranks a real marker beyond
# the bound
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The marker's contract IS "within the first prefix_bytes() bytes"; a line
# beyond the bound is not a marker, by definition, so a decoy inside the
# window winning over a real, contradicting marker past the bound is
# correct behaviour, not a bug -- widening the scan would break done
# criterion 5 (bounded, cheap scanning across hundreds of files). Detecting
# stray marker-shaped lines beyond the bound belongs to package 03's
# hygiene surface, which scans whole files and can afford to -- not here.
# The corpus currently has zero markers in all 345 `.t` files, so package
# 02's backfill cannot collide with a pre-existing out-of-bounds marker.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# OUT OF SCOPE: classic-Mac `\r`-only line endings
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Both regexes anchor with /m, which recognises only `\n` as a line
# separator, never a bare `\r`. A file using old-Mac-style `\r`-only line
# endings collapses into effectively one "line" for anchoring purposes, so
# a marker on any line but the first (or one at true end-of-string) is
# invisible. Not supported, deliberately -- classic Mac line endings are
# not a shape this repo's tooling produces or has ever produced.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# NEVER DIES, NEVER WARNS -- for any input
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every failure path (undef input, unreadable file, binary garbage, a
# missing/directory path) returns a value; none of them throw or emit a
# warning. read_prefix() opens the file `:raw` (no `:crlf`, no
# `:encoding(...)`) precisely so no encoding layer can warn or die on
# malformed bytes -- decision D5. The marker regexes tolerate an optional
# trailing `\r` themselves (decision D4) so a marker line is recognised the
# same way whether the file has LF or CRLF endings.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# MODULE SHAPE -- matches plugins/sandbox/scripts/Theme.pm's house shape
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#   * Core only -- no CPAN.
#   * No Exporter, no default or @EXPORT_OK list. Every call site is fully
#     qualified: TestPlatform::parse_marker($text). Consumers load it with
#     `use TestPlatform ();` after `use lib "$Bin/../lib";`.
#   * Pure logic only. No side effects beyond read_prefix's (read-only) file
#     access.
# =============================================================================

# are expected in the first few lines of a file's header comment, not near

    # token -- silently FORGING an illegal value into a legal one (or vice
    # versa). A line the bound cut in half is not a line, and a marker is a

    #
    # Everything below is line-anchored raw-text matching, which cannot tell
    # code from the inside of a heredoc body, a POD block or a __DATA__ section.
    # That cut BOTH ways and the second way is the one nobody anticipated:
    #
    #   FORGERY  -- a file with no declaration anywhere perl executes, but a
    #               marker-shaped line inside a heredoc, parsed `legal`. Under
    #               package 06's routing that no longer merely guesses a
    #               platform, it SELECTS AN OPERATING SYSTEM.
    #   FALSE CONFLICT -- a file that correctly declares `# platform: windows`
    #               at the top and then writes a marker-bearing fixture through
    #               a heredoc (the natural idiom in this suite, since package 02
    #               gave every .t a marker so fixtures need one too) parsed
    #               `invalid/conflicting-markers`: REFUSED and reported red,
    #               with the diagnostic pointing at a line its author never
    #               meant as a declaration.
    #
    # A positional rule fixes both at once and is far easier to explain than any
    # content rule: text after the first heredoc/POD/__DATA__ is not a
    # declaration, so it can neither forge one nor collide with one. Forgery now
    # yields `absent`, which REFUSES LOUDLY -- exactly what Decision 4 asks for
    # and what the old behaviour silently skipped.
    #
    # MEASURED BEFORE SHIPPING, across all 352 .t files in the tree: 352
    # unchanged, 0 changed. The rule is a no-op on the live corpus and only
    # affects the shapes the bug describes.

# _code_prefix($text) -- everything up to, but not including, the first line

#
# Deliberately a LINE SCAN rather than a perl parse. A real parse is the only
# way to be exactly right about heredocs, and it is far more surface to get
# subtly wrong than the thing it would fix -- the same reasoning
# guard-git-mutations.sh records for choosing a raw fallback over a quoting
# walk with escape/comment/heredoc sub-states.
#
# The three shapes, and why each is unambiguous enough for a line scan:
#   * `__DATA__` / `__END__` -- must be alone on a line, by perl's own rules.
#   * POD -- begins at `^=` followed by an identifier character, by perl's own
#     rules. `=cut` ends it, but we never resume: a declaration after a POD
#     block is already far past where a marker belongs.
#   * a heredoc INTRODUCER (`<<EOF`, `<<'EOF'`, `<<"EOF"`, `<<~EOF`) anywhere
#     in a line. This is the loose one: `<<` is also left-shift and can appear
#     in a string. Cutting early on a false positive costs a marker that sits
#     BELOW a heredoc introducer -- which yields `absent`, a LOUD refusal, not
#     a silent misclassification. Measured across the tree: no live file has a
#     marker in that position.
