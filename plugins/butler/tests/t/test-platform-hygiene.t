#!/usr/bin/env perl
# platform: any
# Oracle for blueprint package 03-enforce-marker (blueprint test-platform-split).
# Derived ONLY from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/test-platform-split/specs/03-enforce-marker-spec.md
# (sections 1-6) and the package ledger's 5 done criteria. NOT derived from any
# implementation: scripts/run-tests.pl does not yet enforce the marker gate at
# the time this file is written, and this file must never add that gate
# itself -- that is the implementer's job, under a review the driver performs
# separately.
#
# THE SOLE DECISION POINT, IN BOTH SURFACES THIS FILE PROVES, IS
# TestPlatform::parse_marker (package 01) -- never a second regex. scan_offenders()
# below (test-local, per spec section 1.5) calls it directly; the real
# scripts/run-tests.pl is driven only as a genuine subprocess via
# RunnerStateHarness::run_runner_bounded, never re-implemented here.
#
# WHY AC-1 IS GREEN TODAY, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE (done criterion
# 5, spec AC-10/AC-11): the standing sweep in PART 1 below passes right now
# ONLY because 02-backfill-scan already landed on every real .t file in the
# tree (349 of 349, commit 3411f29). If package 02 and this package were ever
# reordered -- enforcement shipped before the backfill -- PART 1 would turn
# red on day one, for every real file in the tree at once, BY DESIGN. That is
# the ordering dependency Decision 4 calls a hard edge, not a preference, and
# this file proves it live rather than asserting it in a comment.
#
# WHAT IS EXPECTED TO FAIL TODAY, AND WHY: every assertion in PARTs 2, 3, 5
# and 8 that drives a real run-tests.pl subprocess against a markerless or
# invalid-marker fixture expects the process to REFUSE the file (rc == 1, a
# "PLATFORM MARKER REFUSED" message). scripts/run-tests.pl does not do this
# yet -- verified directly: a markerless fixture handed to run-tests.pl today
# is simply executed and, if its own body is TAP-green, reported green (rc ==
# 0), never refused. Those assertions are the ones this package's
# implementation step must turn green. PART 6 additionally expects
# RunnerStateHarness.pm's three fixture-source generators to carry a legal
# platform marker -- the three-line companion fix Decision 16 folded into
# this package's write set -- which is also not applied yet.
#
# WHAT IS EXPECTED TO PASS TODAY, AND WHY THAT IS NOT VACUOUS: PART 1 (the
# real-tree sweep, package 02's own work), every scan_offenders()-only
# assertion in PARTs 2-4 and 7 (pure TestPlatform.pm consumption, already
# correct), and the "positive pairing" halves of PARTs 2 and 8-9 (a
# legally-marked fixture already runs normally, because nothing today stops
# it) are all real, non-vacuous checks against code that already exists --
# not placeholders waiting for the implementation.
#
# NON-VACUITY, PER THIS BLUEPRINT'S STANDING RULE:
#   - AC-4 (done criterion 4, MANDATORY): a markerless counter-fixture is
#     proven to fire on BOTH surfaces (PART 2), paired immediately with a
#     properly-marked fixture proven to be ACCEPTED by both -- a guard that
#     refused everything unconditionally could not pass both halves.
#   - Every sweep over a collection (PART 1's real-tree glob) also asserts
#     the collection is non-empty, with a floor far below the drifting true
#     count (currently 349; this file must never pin that number -- spec
#     section 6).
#   - "Unreadable" and "absent" are proven to be distinct offender tokens
#     (PART 7), never folded into one another.
#
# AN AMBIGUITY IN THE SPEC, RESOLVED HERE (reported to the driver as such):
# section 3's AC-6 says the conflicting-markers/malformed-marker-line reasons
# are proven "via scan_offenders only (in-process, no subprocess spawn
# needed)"; section 3's AC-7, two paragraphs later, requires proving that
# run-tests.pl's OWN refusal message for malformed-marker-line never says "no
# platform marker found" -- a property that lives in run-tests.pl's message
# text (spec section 1.4), not in scan_offenders' token format (spec section
# 1.5), and which scan_offenders literally cannot exercise. PART 5 resolves
# this in favour of AC-7's more explicit, more specific text: it spawns one
# additional bounded subprocess against the malformed-marker-line fixture,
# because this is the exact failure package 01's own header comment names as
# the reason the "malformed-marker-line" reason exists at all.

# from a genuine top-of-file declaration. Root cause is package 01's
# TestPlatform.pm (out of this package's write set; this batch's
# authorization covers ADDING assertions here, never touching that module).
# This assertion documents today's actual (undesired) behavior so the gap is
# visible and tracked, not silently rediscovered later -- it is NOT a
# statement that this behavior is correct. If/when package 01 confines the
# scan to a genuine leading-comment run, THIS assertion's expected outcome
# will need to change from 'legal' to 'absent', and that is the fix landing,
