# t/82 — immutable oracle for b31-orphaned-judge-marker-recovery.
#
# Derived ONLY from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-butler-overhaul/specs/b31-orphaned-judge-marker-recovery-spec.md
# (C1..C6, plus the vacuity gate) and
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-butler-overhaul/packages/b31-orphaned-judge-marker-recovery.md
# (the live incident: 2026-07-30T07:57:02Z, seven packages parked in one second, all seven
# judge markers carrying a 6103-byte jsonl with a rate-limit rejection and a long-dead pid;
# two of the seven -- b27, s19 -- were `running` with live coordinator work at the time).
# C7 (protocol doc) mirrors t/80's own C6 pattern, per the driver's explicit instruction.
#
# WRITTEN BLIND TO THE FIX. Today the resolve-judge-verdict loop in bp-orchestrator.pl
# classifies a missing verdict on ELAPSED TIME ALONE:
#     next unless $started && ($now - $started) > $t->{judge_to};
#     _log($log, 'judge_timeout', { kind => 'resolve', package => $pkg });
#     $v = { _timeout => 1 };               # normalize_resolve -> park
# It never calls judge_pid()/judge_pid_path() (grepped: those ARE used on the harvest
# paths, never on this one) and never consults the package's own ledger status or
# registry coordinator pid. So every fixture below that should NOT park (C1, C3, C4)
# is expected to park TODAY, and every fixture that should re-fire (C1, C5) never does
# (spawn_judge is never called from this path today at all -- grepped, zero call sites).
# Every assertion is expected to fail on WRONG BEHAVIOUR (an orphan parked, a live judge
# timed out, a running package parked, a re-fire that never happened), never on a Perl
# exception, missing module, or wrong require path -- this file calls only functions
# that exist on disk today (BpOrch::run / mark_judge_inflight / judge_pid_path /
# judge_verdict_path / read_registry / update_registry_pkg), per SYN-23 (grep by
# pattern, never a line number).
#
# CONTRACT THIS ORACLE FIXES (since the spec leaves the exact log/registry shape to the
# implementer, this test pins one -- reusing existing machinery wherever it already
# exists, rather than inventing parallel plumbing):
#   - classification of an orphan is logged as `judge_marker_orphaned` (kind, package,
#     evidence) -- named analogously to the harvest path's `judge_starved`/`judge_crashed`
#     (bp-orchestrator.pl 2005/2010) and to b29's `attempt_discounted_rate_limit`.
#   - the orphan/hung distinction over the JUDGE's own stream (runs/resolve/<pkg>.jsonl,
#     NOT the coordinator's runs/<pkg>.jsonl) reuses b29's already-shipped
#     BpOrch::rate_limit_rejection_evidence("$runs/resolve", $pkg) -- its path
#     construction ("$runs/$pkg.jsonl") lands exactly on judge_log_path($runs,'resolve',$pkg)
#     when handed "$runs/resolve" as its $runs arg, so no third detector is written (spec
#     Sec1 "reuse b29's detector").
#   - the re-fire is bounded by the SAME resolve_attempts/resolve_cap ladder
#     BpJudge::escalation_verdict already enforces for the initial stuck-package
#     escalation (_escalate_stuck) -- not a second, parallel cap. This is the spec's own
#     "the fail-safe is preserved rather than removed" instruction read literally: the
#     existing escalation ladder already IS "re-fire while budget remains, else park",
#     it is simply never consulted for a marker found orphaned on restart.
#   - the actual re-fire is observed via the REAL spawn_judge seam (kind=>'resolve',
#     pkg=>$pkg) being invoked again -- a black-box, implementation-name-independent
#     positive signal -- not merely a log line.
#   - the stale `.pid` marker is unlinked on a successful re-fire (C6), mirroring the
#     harvest re-audit path's own `unlink $jpidf` (bp-orchestrator.pl ~2036).
#
# Style follows t/rate-limit-attempt-isolation.t: mk_bp / go() drives the REAL
# BpOrch::run tick; no reimplementation of the classification logic under test.
#
# =====================================================================================
# MANDATORY VACUITY GATE: C1 ("seven orphaned markers -> zero parks, seven re-fires")
# and C2 ("a judge that ran and hung still parks") are OPPOSITES -- a classifier that
# NEVER parks passes C1 but fails C2; TODAY's classifier (always parks on timeout, the
# unfixed code) passes C2 but fails C1. Both are asserted against fixtures built into
# ONE blueprint dir and resolved by ONE go() tick (dir_main / one call), so no
# constant-returning implementation can satisfy both. The explicit cross-check block
# after C2 demonstrates this directly by diffing park counts between the two groups
# from that single tick's log.
