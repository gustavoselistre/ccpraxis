#!/usr/bin/env perl
# t/76 — oracle for b24, derived ONLY from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-butler-overhaul/specs/b24-spec.md
# (C1..C10, sec.5) and its two corrected ledger claims (sec.0): the blueprint has 71 packages,
# never 47, and NO count is pinned anywhere in this file; the prompt-cache TTL is a
# single-sourced named input the cap is DERIVED from, never "discovered" at runtime.
#
# WRITTEN BLIND TO THE IMPLEMENTATION. reporter/SKILL.md and orchestrator-protocol/SKILL.md
# carry none of the decide/escalate boundary, record, never-block, or widened-Cast language yet
# (verified pre-authoring, disk 2026-08-03); bp-wait-for-decision.pl has no cadence/idle/table
# logic at all. Every assertion below is expected to fail on MISSING GUIDANCE / MISSING CODE,
# never on a Perl exception, a missing module, or a bad require path.
#
# PINNED INTERFACE (spec sec.2/3/4 describe *behaviour*, not a call surface; this oracle names
# the surface, the same way t/81's C5 pins BpGovern::immediate_pause_trigger). Because the write
# set's only code file is bp-wait-for-decision.pl, that is where these land, in package BpWait:
#   BpWait::cadence_cap_minutes($ttl_minutes)      -> cap, DERIVED as $ttl_minutes - margin
#   BpWait::resolve_cadence_minutes(\%opts)        -> { minutes, clamped } ; opts: requested_min,
#                                                      reason, ttl_min (default 60)
#   BpWait::blueprint_terminal(\@packages)         -> bool (I1)
#   BpWait::all_awaiting_decision(\@packages)      -> bool (I2)
#   BpWait::watcher_armed(\@packages)              -> bool (NOT I1 and NOT I2)
#   BpWait::progress_table(\@packages)             -> { done_count => N, rows => [ {id,status} ] }
#   BpWait::classify_decision(\%case)              -> 'escalate' | 'decide'
#   BpWait::autonomous_decision_record(\%case)     -> record hashref, or undef if 'escalate'
# Every call site below is wrapped in eval{} so a missing sub fails its own assertion (absence of
# implementation) rather than dying and aborting the rest of this file.
#
# C10 is a validation command, not re-implemented here:
#   perl plugins/butler/tests/t/wait-for-decision.t     # must stay green (58/58 from disk 2026-08-03)
#
# Package statuses used in fixtures below ('done'/'dropped' terminal; 'blocked'/'parked' = parked
# awaiting a queued human decision; 'pending'/'running' = genuinely in flight) are the existing
