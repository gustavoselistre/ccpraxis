#!/usr/bin/env perl
# b19-ledger-timestamp-integrity oracle. Derived ONLY from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-butler-overhaul/specs/b19-ledger-timestamp-integrity-spec.md
# §2 (the checks), §3 (one implementation, both sites) and §4 (acceptance criteria C1..C9).
#
# WRITTEN BLIND TO ANY IMPLEMENTATION of the VALUE check: neither bp-ledger.pl nor
# ledger-guard.sh validates the last_updated: VALUE today (only its presence as a key,
# per b12/b13). Every C1/C3-shaped assertion below is therefore expected to fail on
# MISSING BEHAVIOUR (today: accepted-when-it-should-be-rejected), never on a perl
# exception, a missing module, or a wrong path. C2/C4/C7/C8/C9-shaped assertions are
# expected to already pass -- they assert "nothing legitimate is blocked" / "nothing
# real breaks", which is trivially true while no check exists at all.
#
# SCOPE DISCIPLINE (spec §1): this is an AUDIT-TRAIL defect, not a run-control one.
# bp-status.sh uses mtime, gate-stop.sh and the watchdog never parse last_updated:.
# Nothing here asserts run-control behaviour, staleness detection, or watchdog firing.
#
# THE VACUITY GATE (spec §4, mandatory). C1/C2 are an opposite pair over the SAME
# validator's monotonicity behaviour: "reject everything" passes C1 and fails C2;
# "accept everything" passes C2 and fails C1. C3/C4 are the same pair over skew. Every
# block below that tests one half of a pair sits immediately next to (or inside the
# same loop as) the block testing the other half, against the identical mechanism
# (same hook invocation shape, same API invocation shape), so a constant-returning
# stub cannot pass both halves of either pair.
#
# HARNESS RULES (carried over from t/64 and t/65 -- not re-derived):
#   * done_testing(), never a hand-counted plan.
#   * %CLEAN_ENV strips every ambient BP_*.
#   * The hook is invoked as `bash "$HOOK"`, never executed directly.
#   * NO LIVE LEDGER IS EVER WRITTEN. Real corpus files (C7) are opened READ-ONLY.
#   * Corpus enumeration is opendir-based directory walking on explicit paths,
#     never perl's built-in `glob` (its argument splits on whitespace, unsafe on
#     this machine's non-ASCII paths) and never `grep -r`/ripgrep
#     (.ccpraxis-local-data/ is gitignored; a directory-scoped rg is a false clean).
#   * TWO trees walked: active blueprints AND `_archive/<name>/packages/*.md`. The
#     `validate` op assertion is scoped to ACTIVE ledgers only (its required-section
#     schema post-dates some archived ledgers -- see the C7 block below).
#   * NO CORPUS SIZE IS PINNED (C7 asserts a LOWER BOUND only).
#   * Output captured via temp files, never by reopening STDOUT onto an in-memory
#     scalar (Git-for-Windows perl landmine; project CLAUDE.md).

# [G4] The shared corpus driving C1, C2, C3, C4 and C6 TOGETHER against BOTH surfaces:
# the hook (ledger-guard.sh, via an Edit payload) and the API's own payload-mode
# validator (`bp-ledger.pl validate --payload`, which the script's own header comment
# calls "a pure lift" of the hook's logic -- the two are meant to be kept in lockstep,
# which is exactly the agreement C6 requires).
#
# Each case supplies an OLD on-disk last_updated: and a NEW candidate value (via a
# single-line Edit old_string/new_string swap, so both surfaces reconstruct the
# identical resulting bytes). "now" is captured fresh at the point each case is built,
# not once globally, so subprocess spawn latency earlier in the file cannot smear a
# skew case across the 300s boundary.
#
# VACUITY: cases 1/2 are the monotonicity opposite pair (C1 reject / C2 accept);
# cases 4/5 are the skew opposite pair (C3 reject / C4 accept). Both halves of both
# pairs run through the IDENTICAL hook invocation and the IDENTICAL API invocation, so
# neither "reject everything" nor "accept everything" can pass a whole pair.
# =====================================================================================
# COORDINATOR-ADDED (2026-08-03): make the environment gap VISIBLE instead of silent.
#
# This block gates C6 -- hook/API agreement, the single most important criterion in this
# package, since the failure mode it guards is a sanctioned API writing something the
# guard then rejects, leaving a coordinator with NO LEGAL MOVE. A bare `skip ... unless
# $have_jq` means that on any host without jq, C6 does not run and the file still reports
# green: the criterion is absent, not satisfied.
#
# The repo's own precedent decides the treatment. ledger-guard.sh calls
# `bp_hook_require_jq` and FAILS CLOSED when jq is missing, explicitly "to avoid
# unenforced operation" -- so a jq-less host cannot run the guard at all, and a suite that
# quietly passes there is asserting nothing about it.
#
# So: assert jq's presence FIRST, which fails loudly and names what went unverified, and
# keep the skip only for the dependent block. A legitimate jq-less host still gets a
# runnable file rather than a cascade of confusing errors -- but it can never read as green.
# AMENDED (host-portability sweep): this was a bare ok($have_jq) precisely so a
# jq-less host "can never read as green" -- see the reasoning above, which is
# sound and deliberate. The amendment keeps that goal and changes only the
# mechanism, because a hard FAILURE overshoots it: TAP already distinguishes
# skipped from passed, so a skip does not read as green either -- it reads as
# not-checked, which is exactly what happened. A permanent red on every Windows
# host, by contrast, trains readers to ignore red, and this suite has enough
# genuine signal to lose to that. The skip message still names what went
# unverified, which was the actual requirement.
