# 142 — g03-reporter-stop-gate, PILLAR 1: registration,
# and its disjointness from the driver's own trigger.
#
# Spec: specs/g03-reporter-stop-gate-spec.md §1.2 (Decision 2 -> DC1), §2.1
# (mark-wakeup.sh registration block), §4 AC1/AC7.
#
# THE CLAIM UNDER TEST. A reporter session registers on the EXACT Bash command
# `bp-watch.pl --arm ... --blueprint <bp>` (Mode B) -- never on any looser
# signal, never on a Read/Grep about bp-watch.pl, never on a Bash command that
# merely NAMES the string without executing it. This is provably disjoint from
# the driver's own `bp-watch.pl --arm --package <bp>/<pkg>` shape because
# bp-watch.pl's own arg parser refuses --package and --blueprint together --
# asserted directly in section B below, since the whole disjointness argument
# depends on that refusal actually existing on disk, not merely being asserted
# in prose.
#
# NON-VACUITY. Every positive fixture (C) is paired with a same-shaped negative
# (D/E/F/G) so a marker written by an over-broad implementation (e.g. "contains
# bp-watch.pl anywhere") is caught, not just a marker written by a correct one.
# AC1's own text calls this out by name ("pair the positive and negative
# fixtures in the same test").

# H. fixbatch step7 / F4 CORRECTION. The ORIGINAL H2 claimed "the DRIVER's
#    existing regex already avoids this exact false positive today", but
#    asserted it against "$ds/.wakeup-pending" -- a path bp_drive_marker()
#    (lib.sh) never writes to under ANY outcome of this fixture (that file is
#    written only by the separate backgrounded-Bash wake-up path, further
#    down in mark-wakeup.sh, which this fixture never reaches). The assertion
#    was vacuously true under both a correct and a broken regex, disclosed
#    candidly in the commit message for 3f03a25 -- fixed here by pointing at
#    the REAL marker path ("$dact/sess-h", where bp_drive_active_dir()
#    resolves to $CCPRAXIS_DRIVE_ACTIVE_DIR per the SAFETY NOTE below).
#
#    Doing so surfaces what the vacuous assertion was hiding: the DRIVER's
#    own arm regex (`mark-wakeup.sh`, `bp-drive-next\.pl[^"]*(next|...)`,
#    untouched by this package -- see dispatch's "Explicitly NOT in this
#    batch") has NO quote-parity check at all. Against this EXACT fixture's
#    JSON encoding (`"command":"echo \"run bp-drive-next.pl next later\""`),
#    the escaped quote characters land OUTSIDE the span between
#    "bp-drive-next.pl" and "next" -- there is no interior quote for
#    `[^"]*` to be stopped by -- so the regex DOES match, and the driver
#    marker IS written. Verified live, not assumed: this is redteam-step6.md
#    LOW-2's finding ("the driver's own arm has the same false positive...
#    out of this package's scope"), previously undetected by H2 because H2
#    asserted against the wrong file. The premise "prior art already solves
#    this" was FALSE for the driver; only the reporter's OWN heuristic (F5-F8
#    above) is fixed by this package. H2 below now asserts the TRUE,
#    verified behavior instead of repeating the false claim.
#
# 2026-08-19 d03-one-shell-noise-stripper CLOSES THE GAP THIS BLOCK RECORDS.
# Almanac report 20260814-093113-34a0 named this exact weakness (the driver
# arm grepping the raw JSON payload, no quote-parity check at all) as its
# sharpest finding and brought it in scope. d03 routes the driver arm through
# the same extract -> bp_strip_shell_noise -> match -> reader-segment-veto
# path the reporter arm already used, so this fixture -- an ECHOED, never
# executed, mention of bp-drive-next.pl -- must now NOT register a driver
# session. H2 below is therefore INVERTED on purpose: `ok(-f ...)` becomes
# `ok(!-f ...)`. This is the fix working, not a change made to satisfy a
# failing test -- the paragraphs above this note stay exactly as they were
# written, because they are an honest, dated record of a real, then-out-of-
# scope bug, and a future reader should still be able to see that the bug
# was real before it was closed. H3, directly below, is UNCHANGED: a genuine
# invocation must still arm, now via the new code path.
#
# SAFETY NOTE (fixture construction, not an assertion change): this fixture
# deliberately trips the DRIVER's own arm regex, which -- unlike every other
# fixture in this file, which stays on the reporter path via run_mark's
# CCPRAXIS_REPORTER_ACTIVE_DIR scoping -- writes through bp_drive_marker(),
# whose directory is controlled by CCPRAXIS_DRIVE_ACTIVE_DIR, defaulting to
# the REAL, live, cross-project marker dir
# (~/.claude/ccpraxis/.drive-solo-active) when unset. This is scoped to a
# tempdir here for the same reason every other fixture in this suite is
# sandboxed: this file must never write into real driver state (see this
# package's own dispatch constraints).
