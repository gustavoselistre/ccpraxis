# Oracle for blueprint tooling-fixes, package 09 (scripts/promote.pl).
# Derived from .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/tooling-fixes/specs/
# 09-promote-array-merge-spec.md (AC-1..AC-18), Decision 26, AND Decision 27
# (blueprint.md) which OVERRIDES the spec's 2.3/2.4 wherever they conflict:
# promotion never widens the operator's permissions beyond what THIS
# promotion itself ships. A change that NARROWS (removing an allow entry,
# adding a deny/ask entry) is judged against the payload's whole history, as
# the spec says. A change that WIDENS (adding an allow entry, removing a
# deny/ask entry) happens only for an entry this promotion itself changed:
# a three-way merge against the payload at the live install's pre-merge HEAD
# (the "baseline"). No baseline payload -> allow additions treat baseline as
# empty (everything current is "new"); deny/ask removals remove nothing. Any
# preference recorded for an array unit (skip-always, left-only, right-only)
# leaves the unit untouched WHATEVER its current relation, printing its own
# kept-pref line (red-team M1, M2).
#
# scripts/promote.pl is consulted only to confirm it exists for the AC-18
# compile check; its merge logic is never read while writing this file.
#
# Fixture shape and helpers are copied from the sibling oracle
# promote-syncs-global-config.t (same blueprint family), including its
# clone_extra_commit()/live_extra_commit() pattern for committing to the
# clone AFTER live has already been cloned from it -- exactly what's needed
# to give live a pre-merge HEAD (the baseline) that differs from the payload
# currently being promoted. Every promote.pl call passes
# --clone/--live/--home explicitly; nothing here ever touches the real
# ~/.claude, the live install, or spawns another .t file, the launcher,
# podman or claude.
#
# AC / red-team / review -> block mapping (grep the tag for every assertion):
#   AC-1  retired entry removed + new entry added (narrowing removal, widening
#         addition against the pre-merge-HEAD baseline)
#   AC-2  exact report lines + summary + exit 0
#   AC-3  order preserved (kept order; additions appended in payload order)
#   AC-4  stale-but-clean live array goes through the same merge
#   AC-5  deny and ask behave like allow/each other, each with their own lines
#         (deny addition = narrowing; ask removal = widening against baseline)
#   AC-6  idempotence: second apply is unchanged, no new backup, kept-local
#   AC-7  dry-run: same lines, would-update, no write, no backup dir
#   AC-8  backup: exactly one, byte-equal to pre-run file
#   AC-9  hand re-added retired entry removed (narrowing); skip-always pref
#         keeps it
#   AC-10 duplicates handled per the stated algorithm
#   AC-11 non-string element / non-array live value -> whole-value path
#         (incl. the missing kept-local assertion, review NIT N1)
#   AC-12 only_left (ask): partial removal, key deleted, untouched-no-line
#         (removal is widening, gated on the baseline)
#   AC-13 only_right (deny): added whole, one line per entry (narrowing,
#         plus the missing no-whole-unit-line assertion, review NIT N2)
#   AC-14 other string arrays (additionalDirectories) untouched
#   AC-15 / NB-1: no baseline payload (fresh install) -> allow additions
#         treat baseline as empty, everything current is "new"
#   AC-16 covered inline: every scenario above asserts exit 0
#   AC-17 sibling oracles pass unmodified -- NOT run from here (house rule:
#         never spawn another .t file); run separately by the harness
#   AC-18 perl -c scripts/promote.pl exits 0
#   NB-2  no baseline payload -> deny/ask widening removal removes nothing
#   M1    red-team MUST: skip-always pref pins an only_left unit (deny), not
#         just diverged
#   M2    red-team MUST: right-only pref pins a diverged unit (allow), not
#         just only_right
#   PREF  the full pref x relation matrix: every pref kind pins every
#         relation (review S3 + red-team M1/M2 combined)
#   S1    red-team SHOULD: an allow entry the operator deleted stays deleted
#         across two promotions; an entry new in THIS promotion is added
#   S2    red-team SHOULD: a deny entry equal to one dropped in an EARLIER
#         promotion is kept; one dropped by THIS promotion is removed
#   NUM   review S1 / red-team S3: JSON numbers are not strings -> whole-value
#         path, no entry lines (live side and payload side)
#   N1    red-team NIT: live/payload settings.json is a JSON non-object
#         (null/[]/"x") -> settings: error, exit 2, nothing written
#   N2    red-team NIT: a symlinked settings.json is preserved (as the
#         CLAUDE.md branch already is, per the sibling oracle's own working
#         fixture on this host), guarded by a symlink-capability probe
#   NONASCII / REORDER: review NIT N3 -- a non-ASCII entry round-trips with
#         no double encoding; a pure reorder is `changes == 0`, no report
#         line, nothing written
#   review S2: every guarded content assertion is preceded by an explicit
#         shape ok() and is itself unconditional (no more silent
#         `if ref(...)` skips that could pass vacuously)
#   S4 (red-team, write_bytes_atomic print/close failure): NOT covered here.
#         See the note at the end of this file for why.
