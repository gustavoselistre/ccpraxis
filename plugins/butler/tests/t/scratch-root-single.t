# Oracle for blueprint package 04-scratch-root (blueprint test-platform-split).
# Derived ONLY from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/test-platform-split/specs/04-scratch-root-spec.md
# (260 lines). NOT derived from any implementation: at the time this file is
# written, HostCaps.pm has no scratch_root() sub, and StewardTest.pm /
# TestSandbox.pm have no `require HostCaps` at all -- every assertion below
# that depends on scratch_root() existing is EXPECTED TO FAIL on "Undefined
# subroutine", never on a bug in this file's own scaffolding.
#
# AC -> block mapping (ledger's 8 done criteria; AC7/AC8 are [R], AC4/AC6 are
# [S] -- see "OUT OF SCOPE" below):
#   AC1 (criterion 1, one owner/derivation)   -> "ONE DEFINER", "BAREWORD
#         REQUIRE", "AC1 DERIVATION" blocks
#   AC2 (criterion 2, three-constraints-at-once) -> "AC2/AC3: NATIVE PATH",
#         "AC2/AC3: ASCII", "AC2/AC3: NO 8.3 (subdirs)",
#         "AC2/AC3: NO 8.3 (root, functional substitute)",
#         "AC2/AC3: CONTAINER REACHABILITY"
#   AC3 (criterion 3, each constraint names its incident) -> every test name
#         in the five AC2 blocks above carries its incident/decision citation
#   AC5 (criterion 5, override validated not trusted)  -> "AC5: OVERRIDE
#         CASE TABLE" block (rows 1,3,4,5,6,7 -- see INTERPRETATION NOTE 1)
#   native_tmp()/git_path() regression (spec 2.4's landmine, task's own
#         "assertions that matter most" #6) -> "NATIVE_TMP MUST NOT MOVE"
#
# OUT OF SCOPE FOR THIS FILE, ON PURPOSE:
#   AC4 [S] (steward git suite stays green) and AC6 [S] (full sweep has no
#   new red) are sweep-level criteria per the spec's own table -- "no single
#   .t assertion can stand in for it". They are verified by actually running
#   plugins/steward/tests/t/*.t and scripts/run-tests.pl as part of package
#   validation, not by anything in this file.
#   AC7 [R] (the package emits the exact Add-MpPreference command) and AC8
#   [R] (the ledger's Escalation section + read-only verifier) are
#   documentation deliverables per the spec's own flag -- verified by report
#   / ledger inspection. Inventing a .t assertion that greps the ledger for
#   prose would be a test that fails for the wrong reasons; none is here.
#   This file also NEVER runs Add-MpPreference / Set-MpPreference /
#   Get-MpPreference, and never mkdir's anything directly at a drive root --
#   the only thing that may create plugins/butler/tests/lib/HostCaps.pm's
#   C:/ccpraxis-scratch is HostCaps::scratch_root() itself, called as the
#   function under test, never this file acting directly on the filesystem.
#
# INTERPRETATION NOTES (recorded, not silently resolved -- a guess here
# becomes an immutable contract per the test-writer's own brief):
#
#   1. "ALL SIX ROWS" vs. the 2.3 table's SEVEN rows. Section 2.3 says "All
#      six rows are exercised... rows 1 and 3 are additionally exercised
#      through [derivers]", but the table has seven rows (1=unset/Windows,
#      2=unset/non-Windows, 3..7=override cases). Read literally against
#      AC5's own text -- "rows 1 and 3 ... rows 4/6/5" (five rows named) --
#      "six" resolves to {1,3,4,5,6,7}, i.e. every row EXCEPT row 2, which is
#      the one row that only applies off Windows and cannot be exercised
#      directly on this Windows host. This file exercises all six of
#      {1,3,4,5,6,7} for real, plus row 2 as a clearly-labelled BEST-EFFORT
#      bonus (achieved by faking $^O in a child process -- legitimate
#      because HostCaps checks $^O dynamically inside each sub, exactly as
#      native_tmp()/git_path() already do; this is exercising the pseudocode
#      CONTRACT in 2.2, not guessing at an implementation detail).
#
#   2. MEMOIZATION FORCES SUBPROCESSES FOR THE OVERRIDE TABLE. 2.2's own
#      pseudocode caches scratch_root()'s result in %cache after the FIRST
#      call in a process. Calling HostCaps::scratch_root() repeatedly in
#      THIS file's own process with different $ENV{CCPRAXIS_SCRATCH_ROOT}
#      values between calls would silently keep returning the FIRST result
#      forever -- a fixture fault indistinguishable from a real defect. The
#      spec does not spell this out, but StewardTest.pm's own header names
#      exactly this class of problem for vault-sync.pl's HOME handling ("must
#      be set in the CHILD env BEFORE the script is spawned... which is why
#      every scenario step shells out instead of calling subs in-process").
#      This file follows the same discipline: every override-table row runs
#      in a fresh child perl process. The DEFAULT (unset) scenario is the
#      first and only scratch_root() call this file's own process ever makes
#      directly, so its cache is never polluted by a later override test.
#
#   3. THE ROOT'S OWN "NO 8.3 ALIAS" CHECK IS SUBSTITUTED, WITH EVIDENCE.
#      AC2(c) asks for a functional check "via cmd.exe's %~sI... not by
#      string inspection". Two empirical findings from this host, both
#      reproduced while writing this file, changed how that is operationalised:
#        (a) Direct cmd.exe invocation (via backticks, system(), or list-form
#            system(), from this test-execution environment) HANGS rather
#            than running %~sI and returning -- confirmed by a genuine 120s
#            timeout on `cmd.exe /c "echo x"` with no shell wrapper involved.
#            cygpath (already on PATH, part of the same Git-for-Windows/MSYS
#            toolchain, calling the identical underlying
#            GetShortPathName/GetLongPathName Win32 APIs) does the same job
#            without hanging, so `cygpath -d` / `cygpath -w -l` are used
#            below as a mechanism-equivalent, non-hanging substitute for
#            %~sI -- not a weaker check, a working one.
#        (b) MORE IMPORTANTLY: `C:/ccpraxis-scratch` -- the fixed root chosen
#            by Decision 7, not something this file or the implementer can
#            change -- is 16 characters long. This volume has 8dot3name
#            generation ENABLED (confirmed directly: `mkdir C:/ccpraxis-scratch`
#            then `cygpath -d` on it returns `C:\CCPRAX~1`, distinct from the
#            long form, and a plain 9-character ASCII test directory with no
#            special characters at all reproduces the same aliasing while an
#            8-character one does not -- this is a pure LENGTH threshold, not
#            an ASCII or embedded-character issue). That means a literal
#            "the root's own directory entry has no distinct short alias"
#            check is UNSATISFIABLE for this specific, spec-fixed root name,
#            regardless of how well HostCaps.pm is implemented -- asserting
#            it literally would make this oracle permanently red even after
#            a perfect implementation, which is exactly the "wrong reason"
#            failure mode the test-writer brief forbids introducing. The
#            spec's own text elsewhere sanctions exactly this substitution
#            for this exact constraint: "the functional form of the 8.3
#            constraint, not a string check" (observable behavior 11) is used
#            here in place of a literal alias-equality check ON THE ROOT
#            SEGMENT ONLY. The three PLUGIN SUBDIRECTORIES (butler=6,
#            steward=7, sandbox=7 characters, all <=8) are NOT subject to this
#            problem -- confirmed empirically the same way -- so they get the
#            literal short-name-equality check AC2(c) actually asks for,
#            compared by BASENAME (the path segment under test), since a
#            full-path comparison would spuriously "fail" on the root
#            segment's own unavoidable alias even when the subdirectory name
#            itself is perfectly alias-free.
#
# NON-VACUITY STRATEGY (this blueprint's own standing rule):
#   - Every detector-style assertion (native-path regex, ASCII regex, the
#     8.3 basename comparator, the %INC single-key count, the "one definer"
#     source-text regex, the die-message regexes) is followed by a
#     COUNTER-FIXTURE proving the same predicate fires on data engineered to
#     trip it.
#   - Where something is asserted ABSENT (no independent scratch_root() in
#     StewardTest.pm/TestSandbox.pm; no string-path require of HostCaps.pm),
#     the counter-fixture supplies the POSITIVE case on fabricated text, so
#     the absence check cannot be trivially true because nothing was ever
#     checked for real.
