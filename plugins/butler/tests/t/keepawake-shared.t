# t/111 — the wake-lock is ONE definition, and the FLEET
# holds it too.
#
# WHAT THIS PINS, AND WHY IT IS NOT PARANOIA.
#
# The keep-awake mechanism existed only in bp-drive-next.pl — the SOLO driver,
# the path where a human is sitting in the session and would notice a suspended
# host. bp-orchestrator.pl, which runs headless coordinators for hours with
# nobody watching, held no wake-lock at all. The lock was on the path that needs
# it least and absent from the one that needs it most, and a suspend on the
# fleet is both unrecoverable and unwitnessed. 3c661a0 records the real event:
# a watchdog armed for 1800s reported 7962s elapsed because the host suspended.
#
# The obvious fix — copy the helpers into the orchestrator — is a mistake this
# repo has already paid for twice: match_any needed t/108 to guard its two
# copies, and the token floor lived in three places (one an invisible default),
# which is how the keeper silently ran a 1-hour floor after the gate had moved
# to ten minutes. So this file pins BOTH properties: one definition, and both
# drivers using it.

# ---- THE LEAK: the recorded pid must be valid to OTHER processes -------------
#
# Measured 2026-08-13: 52 orphaned keep-awake PowerShells, ~52 MB each, holding
# 2.7 GB and 52 simultaneous ES_CONTINUOUS wake-locks on the operator's host,
# very plausibly the difference that tipped Windows into the low-virtual-memory
# condition that killed the podman VM and both of their sandboxes.
#
# CAUSE: spawn() wrote perl's fork() return value into keepawake.pid. On
# Git-for-Windows perl fork is EMULATED and returns a PSEUDO-pid (e.g. 447298)
# meaningful only inside the process that forked. Every `bp-drive-next.pl next`
# is a fresh process, so its kill(0,$pid) always failed, the idempotency check
# never fired, and each invocation spawned another lock it could never release.
#
# The fix hands keep-awake.ps1 -PidFile so the HELPER records its own real
# Windows pid. These assertions pin that, because the symptom is invisible in a
# single process: a pseudo-pid validates fine inside the process that made it,
# which is exactly why this survived.
