# 139 — IMMUTABLE ORACLE for w02's
# §2.5 edit to plugins/butler/skills/coordinator-protocol/SKILL.md:
# criterion 6 ("coordination, not a dependency" with e03) is satisfied by
# documenting the dispatch-log bracket and the interrupt doctrine somewhere
# a headless coordinator's own Task dispatch can adopt it from, WITHOUT
# adding a DAG edge and WITHOUT documenting stop-gate.sh here (that
# gate is drive-solo-scoped by construction — coordinator-protocol's own
# stop discipline is stop-gate.sh, untouched by this package).
#
# Spec: .../specs/w02-dispatch-budget-and-interrupt-spec.md §2.5, §3
# behavior 15, §4 AC6. AC6 is explicit that "the doctrine text exists and
# is reusable in principle" is all that is testable — whether e03 actually
# adopts it is that package's business, not assertable here.
#
# Text-only, no execution — same posture as t/135 for drive-solo/SKILL.md.
# Written against the file's CURRENT (pre-w02) content: B1 is RED today by
# construction (the file does not mention bp-dispatch-log.pl at all yet).
# B2/B3 are regression guards that also hold true TODAY (the file mentions
# neither stop-gate.sh nor duplicates the canonical prompt) — they
# are not red-before-green assertions, they are invariants meant to hold
# across the edit, same class as t/137's I1.
