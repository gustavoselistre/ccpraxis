# 133 — IMMUTABLE ORACLE for w01-bp-watch's pure
# decision core (package BpWatch in plugins/butler/scripts/bp-watch.pl).
#
# Spec: .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/butler-and-dashboard-overhaul/specs/
#       w01-bp-watch-spec.md §2.1 (interfaces), §3 (behaviors), §4 (AC).
#
# bp-watch.pl DOES NOT EXIST YET at the time this file is written (test-writer
# runs before the implementer). `require $SCRIPT` is therefore expected to
# fail; caught with eval (house pattern — t/status-read-api.t), so every
# BpWatch:: call below dies "Undefined subroutine", $got stays undef, and each
# `is()`/`ok()` fails as a genuine not-ok — the RIGHT reason: missing behavior,
# never a scaffolding bug of this file's own making.
#
# THE FOUR INVARIANTS ARE THE HEART OF THIS FILE. Sections B/C/D/E pin them
# SEPARATELY, each with its own falsifiable assertion and its own counter-
# fixture, so a partial implementation reads as partial rather than as a
# single pass/fail blob. Section F pins the umbrella rule (§0) directly.
