# b17-answer-decision-completeness oracle. Derived ONLY from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-butler-overhaul/specs/b17-answer-decision-completeness-spec.md
# (the four verified defects in section 0, the C1..C8 acceptance criteria in section 2).
#
# WRITTEN AGAINST THE CURRENT bp-answer-decision.pl, WHICH HAS NONE OF THE FOUR FIXES:
#   1. no cold lever      -- `session_id` appears nowhere in the script; `reset` cannot clear it.
#   2. no write-set widen -- options are exactly --action/--note/--decision/--package/--bp-dir.
#   3. unknown kinds      -- kind_family() knows only reauth|contract-drift as 'fleet'; every other
#                            kind (including 'broken-env', which IS fleet-family in the real
#                            producer) silently defaults to 'package' with no validation at all.
#   4. --note dropped     -- append_human_decision(...) if $plan->{relaunch}, true only for
#                            relaunch/reset; accept/drop silently discard the note and exit 0.
# Every assertion below is expected to FAIL NOW against one of these four gaps -- never against a
# Perl exception, a missing module, or a wrong path (the script exists and runs fine today; it is
# simply incomplete). Where a sub-test currently PASSES (e.g. C2, C7's relaunch/reset cases, C5's
# package-family kinds), that is because the corresponding half of the defect does not exist for
# that input -- it is kept as the paired guard so an over-eager fix cannot regress it.
#
# =====================================================================================
# INTERFACE PINNED BY THIS ORACLE (nothing below exists on disk yet, so this oracle -- not any
# implementation -- fixes the contract, per the spec's "implementer's choice" wording):
#
#   - Cold lever (deliverable 1.1): `--action reset` (both --decision and direct --package modes)
#     CLEARS the package's registry `session_id` (absent, JSON null, or empty string all count as
#     "cleared" -- this oracle does not prescribe the JSON representation). `--action relaunch`
#     MUST NOT touch it.
#   - Write-set widening (deliverable 1.2): a new `--widen-write-set PATH` option (repeatable
#     semantics not required by this oracle -- one call, one path) that ADDS to the package
#     ledger's frontmatter `write_set:` value (colon-separated, per bp-lib.sh's match_any/registry
#     convention already in this repo), going through bp-ledger.pl rather than a second raw
#     frontmatter writer.
#   - Narrowing refusal (deliverable 1.2 / C4): a new `--set-write-set VALUE` option (full-
#     replacement semantics) that must be REFUSED outright -- named deliberately without the words
#     "narrow"/"replace"/"additive" so a generic "unknown option" pre-fix failure cannot
#     accidentally satisfy the refusal-wording assertion below.
#   - Kind coverage (deliverable 1.3): every kind bp-orchestrator.pl's OWN producers actually queue
#     (derived below, not hand-typed) must route to a deterministic outcome; anything else must
#     fail loudly, changing nothing.
#   - Note persistence (deliverable 1.4): `--note` persists into the ledger's "## Human decision"
#     section on every one of relaunch/reset/accept/drop.
#
# =====================================================================================
# MANDATORY VACUITY GATE (spec section 2's own standing rule):
#   - C1/C2 are opposites ("always clear" passes C1, fails C2; "never clear" the reverse) and are
#     asserted in the SAME block below, against the REAL bp-resume-sweep.sh verdict (not just the
#     registry mutation): C1's fixture is built so that, absent the fix, the sweep would call it
#     warm-resume (transcript fresh, cache_observations hit, session_id present) -- a fix that
#     "always clears" would still pass C1 (cold) but a script that never clears at all is caught by
#     the SAME fixture failing to go cold. C2 reuses the identical warm fixture through `relaunch`
#     and requires the sweep STILL says warm-resume.
#   - C3/C4 are asserted together (adjacent blocks, same starting fixture): C3 first proves the
#     named path was actually added (positive), THEN that every pre-existing path survived
#     byte-identically; C4 then proves an explicit narrow/replace attempt is refused with a
#     specifically-worded cause, not merely "unknown option".
#   - C5 first derives the kind list from bp-orchestrator.pl's OWN queue_needs_you/
#     _enter_pause_manual/_block_and_queue call sites (never a hand-typed list that would drift),
#     then exercises each; C6 uses a kind that is asserted (via the SAME derivation) to be ABSENT
#     from that list, so the "unknown kind" case can never accidentally collide with a real one.
#   - C7 asserts the note's presence PER ACTION, individually, for relaunch/reset/accept/drop --
#     an aggregate assertion would pass with accept/drop still silently dropping it, which IS the
#     regression defect 4 is.
#   - C8 is negative-only ("nothing silently discarded"); each sub-case first asserts the script
#     accepted the input (positive gate) before asserting the failure/refusal it must produce when
#     it cannot honour that input.
#
# NO SKIP appears anywhere below except ONE block explicitly gated on `jq` (bp-resume-sweep.sh's
# own hard dependency, via bp-lib.sh's require_cmd), and that gate is preceded by an `ok(...)`
# assertion of jq's presence so a missing jq fails loudly and names what went unverified, rather
# than silently vanishing as a false green.
