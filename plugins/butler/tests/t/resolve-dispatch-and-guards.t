# platform: any
# e03-autonomous-resolution oracle, part 2: the orchestrator-side wiring --
# the new 'chronic-scoping' %KIND_REGISTRY entry, the fourth judge-kind
# dispatch reuse ('escalation-resolve'), the new bp-escalation-resolver agent
# contract, and two REGRESSION GUARDS explicitly mandated by the spec:
# AC-BQ (_block_and_queue gains no argument; t/115 untouched) and the
# b24-distinctness guard restated at the orchestrator/agent boundary.
# Derived ONLY from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/butler-and-dashboard-overhaul/specs/
# e03-autonomous-resolution-spec.md (§2.2, §2.5, §2.7) -- never from any
# implementation.
#
# WRITTEN AGAINST THE CURRENT TREE, WHICH HAS NONE OF THIS YET:
#   - %BpOrch::KIND_REGISTRY has no 'chronic-scoping' key.
#   - No 'escalation-resolve' judge-kind tick-loop block exists anywhere in
#     bp-orchestrator.pl (no source occurrence of the literal string at all).
#   - plugins/butler/agents/bp-escalation-resolver.md does not exist.
#
# TWO GROUPS ARE DELIBERATELY GREEN NOW (tripwires, not "missing behavior"
# assertions) -- named explicitly per this task's own instruction to write
# them despite starting green:
#   - GROUP BQ (AC-BQ): nothing has touched _block_and_queue or t/115 yet, so
#     these assertions currently hold trivially. They exist to go RED the
#     moment a future implementer adds an argument to _block_and_queue or
#     edits t/115 -- exactly the regression this package's own spec (§2.2)
#     names as a hard, independently-checkable acceptance criterion.
#   - GROUP WAIT (b24 positive control): bp-wait-for-decision.pl's existing
#     autonomy pair is untouched by this package by design; asserting it
#     still exists/still differs from anything e03 adds is a tripwire against
#     future drift, not evidence e03 itself is implemented.
# Every other group is a genuine RED-now assertion of missing behavior.
