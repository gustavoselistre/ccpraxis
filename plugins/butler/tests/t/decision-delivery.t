#!/usr/bin/env perl
# b18-and-park-loop oracle. Derived ONLY from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-butler-overhaul/specs/b18-and-park-loop-spec.md
# (the scout in section 0, THE RULE in section 1, C1..C7 in section 3).
#
# THE DEFECT (spec section 0): `append_human_decision` in bp-answer-decision.pl appends a
# "## Human decision (resolve)" block at EOF but NOTHING updates "## Next action" --
# `grep -c 'set-next-action\|Next action'` on the script returns 0. The resume prompt (see
# bp-launch.sh's "continue from the 'Next action' section") points a resuming coordinator at
# the section that STILL HOLDS THE STALE PARK TEXT that caused the park in the first place.
# A coordinator re-parked 91 seconds after being answered, reporting "No new owner decision
# arrived" -- the answer and the place the coordinator reads are different parts of the file.
#
# WRITTEN AGAINST THE CURRENT bp-answer-decision.pl, WHICH DOES NOT YET FIX THIS: every
# assertion below that fails is expected to fail because "## Next action" is untouched by
# --note (absence of implementation), never because of a Perl exception, a missing module, or
# a wrong path -- the script exists and runs fine today; it is simply incomplete in exactly
# the way the spec's scout documents.
#
# =====================================================================================
# MANDATORY VACUITY GATE (spec section 3's own standing rule), and how this oracle honours it:
#   - C1/C2 are asserted TOGETHER, on the SAME post-answer ledger read, using a fixture whose
#     Next action starts as a distinctive STALE marker string. "Append the answer beneath the
#     stale text" would satisfy C1 alone (the note is present somewhere) while still failing
#     C2 (the stale text the coordinator would still see is not gone) -- exactly the actual
#     failure mode the spec calls out. Neither assertion alone would catch that shape; together
#     they do.
#   - C4 is negative-only ("no new raw ledger writer"). Before trusting that count, a dedicated
#     block first asserts (positively) that the CLI's answer actually rewrote the ledger file at
#     all -- otherwise "the writer count didn't change" would be true for the trivial and
#     useless reason that nothing happened.
#   - C6 (every action that carries a note: relaunch, reset, accept, drop) is asserted PER
#     ACTION inside a loop, never aggregated -- b17's own oracle proved an aggregate assertion
#     hides exactly this shape of defect (two of four actions silently broken).
#   - C7 reads through BpOrch::ledger_next_action($bpdir, $pkg) -- the REAL function
#     bp-orchestrator.pl itself uses to surface a package's Next action (e.g. into an
#     escalation message) -- not a fixture string and not a hand-rolled regex of this oracle's
#     own. This is "the section the resume prompt names", read the way production code reads it.
#
# NO SKIP appears anywhere below.
