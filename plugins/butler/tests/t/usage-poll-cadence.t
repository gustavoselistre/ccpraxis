# t/81 — immutable oracle for b30-floor.
#
# Derived from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-butler-overhaul/specs/b30-floor-spec.md
# sections 0, 2 and 4 (C1..C7). Exercises the REAL BpGovern functions
# (plugins/butler/scripts/bp-govern.pl) with injected samples — no live API, no sleeping,
# no wall clock. `window_cadence` currently (pre-fix) reads:
#
#     return 1800 if !defined $burn || $burn <= 0;
#     return clamp(($headroom / $burn) * 0.5, 60, 1800);
#
# which is fail-UNSAFE on unknown burn (returns the SLOW floor instead of the fast one), treats a
# flat burn as automatically safe regardless of proximity to the ceiling, and has no ceiling-
# proximity cap at all. This file is written BLIND to the fix — every C1/C2/C3 assertion below is
# expected to fail on the CURRENT wrong return value, never on a Perl exception, a missing module,
# or a wrong require path.
#
# SYN-23: nothing here cites a bp-govern.pl / bp-orchestrator.pl line number; locate by grep pattern.
#
# MANDATORY VACUITY GATE (spec §4's own standing rule): C3 (unknown burn -> FAST) and C4 (idle flat
# burn -> SLOW/MAX) are opposites, and each is trivially satisfiable alone: an implementation that
# always returns CADENCE_MIN_S passes C3 but fails C4; one that always returns CADENCE_MAX_S passes
# C4 but fails C3. Both blocks below assert POSITIVE, CONCRETE, DIFFERENT numeric outcomes
# (CADENCE_MIN_S vs CADENCE_MAX_S) from inputs that differ ONLY in the one dimension the rule cares
# about (span-under-minimum / dt<=0 / too-few-samples vs. a long flat span) — so no constant-
# returning implementation of window_cadence can pass both C3 and C4 in this file: C3 requires the
# return to equal CADENCE_MIN_S (and explicitly NOT CADENCE_MAX_S) on three fixtures, C4 requires
# the return to equal CADENCE_MAX_S (and explicitly NOT CADENCE_MIN_S) on a fourth. A hardcoded-fast
# implementation fails C4's "== CADENCE_MAX_S" assertions; a hardcoded-slow implementation fails
# C3's "== CADENCE_MIN_S" / "!= CADENCE_MAX_S" assertions. This is verified explicitly in the C3/C4
# block below via a direct cross-check (asserting the two outcomes are NOT equal to each other).
