# t/112 — the stop gate is a STATE MACHINE.
#
# THE FAILURE. A turn that ends mid-run schedules nothing: no notification is
# pending, nothing wakes the session, and an unattended run simply stops until
# someone notices hours later. It recurred all evening, and each time the
# remedy was written down as guidance. Guidance did not hold — the same lesson
# guard-git-mutations.sh was born from, where a prohibited command destroyed a
# completed fix-batch that an instruction was supposed to protect.
#
# TWO DETECTORS WERE TRIED FIRST, AND BOTH WERE WRONG IN THE SAME WAY.
#   1. "A Bash command containing the token BP_STALL_GUARD clears the alarm."
#      A guard that died on launch contains the token just as well as a live
#      one. It verified ceremony, not function.
#   2. "Deny if the closing prose promises work." Sidestepped by rephrasing a
#      sentence — a gate the guarded party can talk its way out of.
# A detector is only as good as its guesses. So the default is inverted:
#
#   INERT until a run demonstrably starts; then DENY until the agent RESOLVES
#   it, with exactly two resolutions and no third:
#       finish — nothing pending
#       pause  — a LIVE watcher will wake us (verified pid + future deadline)
#
# Silence is not a resolution, and neither is a plausible sentence.
