# 138 — IMMUTABLE ORACLE for w02's SKILL.md
# doctrine changes to plugins/butler/skills/drive-solo/SKILL.md: the
# per-dispatch budget stamp (§2.4 step 1), the interrupt-and-report move
# positioned between waiting and killing (§2.4 step 4, Decision 8,
# criterion 4/5), and the "Known residual" paragraph's replacement (§2.4
# step 5), which the retired bp-watch-doctrine coverage does NOT pin (confirmed by the
# architect's own re-read, spec §2.1 "SKILL.md consequence").
#
# Spec: .../specs/w02-dispatch-budget-and-interrupt-spec.md §2.4, §3
# behaviors 13-14, §4 AC4 (documented move + canonical prompt — the
# BEHAVIORAL half, "the worker actually returns promptly", is explicitly
# NOT mechanically testable and is not attempted here), AC5 (imperative
# "do not defer again" framing — whether a future driver actually OBEYS it
# is likewise not testable and not attempted here).
#
# This file reads plugins/butler/skills/drive-solo/SKILL.md as TEXT only —
# no require, no execution — the same posture t/135 already uses for this
# file. It is written against the file's CURRENT (pre-w02) content, so most
# assertions below are RED today by construction: the interrupt doctrine,
# the bp-dispatch-log.pl stamp, and the residual-paragraph replacement do
# not exist yet. Recorded per-assertion, not assumed.

# strictly BEFORE that PROSE occurrence (the one outside the table) — so
