# match_any is defined TWICE:
#   plugins/butler/hooks/lib.sh      — the copy guard-writes.sh actually sources
#   plugins/butler/scripts/bp-lib.sh — the copy the bp-*.pl tooling sources
#
# The bodies are byte-identical today, so this file is GREEN on arrival. It is
# not pinning a defect; it is pinning the ABSENCE of one. match_any decides
# whether a path is inside a write set or is "a test", which makes it a
# security-relevant path matcher — and a duplicated security-relevant matcher
# with no drift guard is a defect waiting for the first divergent edit. If one
# copy gains a fix (say, specificity ranking) and the other does not, the hook
# and the tooling silently disagree about what is in scope, and nothing tells
# anyone.
#
# WHY BODY-COMPARISON AND NOT BEHAVIOUR-COMPARISON. A behavioural test would
# have to enumerate inputs, and the divergence that matters is precisely the
# input nobody thought to enumerate. Comparing the extracted function bodies
# catches every divergence, including the one the test author did not imagine.
#
# This test does NOT demand the duplication be removed. Collapsing the two into
# one shared file is a real option, but hooks/lib.sh is out of a02's write set,
# and a hook that sources a script-tree file is its own coupling decision. The
# test states the invariant; how it is satisfied is left open.

match_any has DIVERGED between its two definitions.

  hooks/lib.sh      <- sourced by guard-writes.sh (the enforcement path)
  scripts/bp-lib.sh <- sourced by the bp-*.pl tooling

This matters because match_any decides write-set membership and test-path
classification. Two copies that disagree mean the hook and the tooling disagree
about what is in scope, with no symptom until something is wrongly allowed or
wrongly denied.

Fix by making the change in BOTH copies, or by collapsing them into one shared
definition. Do NOT satisfy this test by relaxing it.
