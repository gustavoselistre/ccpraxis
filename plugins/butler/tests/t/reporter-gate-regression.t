# 145 — g03-reporter-stop-gate, DC5/DC8: the
# reporter branch must not weaken the driver's existing stop discipline, and
# the pre-existing oracle suite must be re-measured against the SAME pass
# counts after this package's edits land.
#
# Spec: specs/g03-reporter-stop-gate-spec.md §4 AC6, AC9.
#
# WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO. AC6 explicitly frames itself as "a diff-and-
# rerun check, not a 'the file wasn't edited' check" — t/drive-loop-gate.t
# itself is READ-ONLY ground truth (per t/137's own precedent, which already
# established this house convention for a sibling package) and is NEVER
# copied or duplicated here. Section A below runs the actual, unmodified file
# as a real subprocess and asserts its own pass/fail shape — the strongest
# available proxy for "unmodified behavior", short of literally diffing the
# file (which a `docs-consistency`/`shell-syntax` check elsewhere in this
# package's `checks:` line already covers for the file's TEXT never having
# been edited at all).
#
# AC9 (full two-suite green baseline) is a PROCESS criterion, not a per-file
# oracle: recording it against the ~200 files across plugins/butler/tests and
# plugins/sandbox/tests inside a single .t file would be prohibitively slow
# and duplicates work the validation step (pipeline step 5) already owns.
# Section B narrows this to the SPECIFIC files this package's own ledger and
# dispatch prompt name as "MUST STAY GREEN" — the ones this package's diff
# can plausibly touch — re-measured here as a concrete regression tripwire,
# with the full-suite baseline recorded in this file's own test-writer
# report instead (see report §"baseline", captured BEFORE any implementation
# edit, matching this file's own git-untouched state at write time).
#
# WHY THIS FILE IS SLOW, AND WHY THAT IS NOT BEING "FIXED". Measured standalone
# 2026-08-26: 52s, of which 50s is the four child files (t/94 13s, t/112 21s,
# t/120 5s, t/137 11s). It is therefore ~100% child re-execution — and the sweep
# already runs all four directly, so A1/A3/B1/B3 (exit 0, zero "not ok")
# duplicate work the sweep does anyway.
#
# That is the same shape removed from t/statusline-marker-glyph.t, but it is
# NOT the same case, and the difference is the whole reason this stays: t/166's
# nested runs added no assertion the sweep did not already make. Here A2/B2 pin
# each child's PLAN COUNT, and a plan count under done_testing() cannot be known
# without running the file. Delete the runs and the floors go with them.
#
# The cheap alternative was considered and rejected: have scripts/run-tests.pl
# record plan counts and have this file read them. That buys ~50s of a ~405s
# sweep in exchange for a cache whose staleness rule is a new way to pass
# wrongly — a bad trade for a CANONICAL oracle. Revisit only if the sweep's tail
# becomes the binding constraint.

    # A FLOOR, NOT AN EQUALITY. The baseline was 33; the guard is against LOSS.
    #
    # An exact count also fails when someone STRENGTHENS t/94, which is the
    # opposite of what this file exists to protect and turns every legitimate
    # new assertion into a red test in an unrelated package. That has now cost
    # time twice — this pin and the t/112 pin below, changed for the same reason
    # on the same grounds — so it is worth naming the general rule: an oracle
    # that pins a count must pin the direction it cares about, or it treats
    # improvement as breakage.
    #
    # The cost is stated honestly: a change that deletes one assertion and adds
    # two passes here. A3's zero-"not ok" check and A1's exit code are what
    # catch a silent skip; they do not depend on this number.
    # RE-BASELINED 2026-08-26: 33 -> 39. A floor only has teeth while it sits at
    # the file's actual count; every legitimate assertion added since widens the
    # gap it will tolerate before firing. At 33 against an actual 39 this had
    # already gone slack by six. Re-baselining is the maintenance action the
    # "honest cost of the floor" note in section B describes but never scheduled,
    # so it is done here for both floors at once. Both of t/94's and t/112's SKIP
    # blocks use the COUNTED form (`skip 'reason', N`), which emits its N `ok #
    # skip` lines either way — so the plan count does not move with the
    # environment and a tight floor cannot go red on a machine that lacks
    # bp-runstate.pl.

    # probe, per that package's spec §4.8, and adds new AC1-AC22 probe/marker
    # acceptance criteria. AC26 requires this floor to move UP with the file's

    # not.
    #
    # THE HONEST COST OF THE FLOOR, stated rather than glossed: once the file
    # grows past its baseline, a floor can no longer detect a single lost
    # assertion offset by a single added one. It still detects net loss, which
    # is the failure mode with teeth. This is exactly the correction package
    # d01 of the predecessor initiative made to t/163's own `is(scalar(@all_t),
