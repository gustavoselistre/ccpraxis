# 00 — the shared-shape lint, as a TEST.
#
# WHY THIS IS A TEST AND NOT JUST A SCRIPT
#
# `bp-shape-lint.pl` existed first, and that was not enough. A lint only helps
# if somebody runs it, and a protocol paragraph only helps if somebody reads it.
# Both are memory aids, and this failure mode already beat memory SEVEN times in
# one blueprint — the seventh firing while the operator's own decision was being
# recorded, because decision-context-split.t pinned the decisions table at exactly 26 ids.
#
# So it runs in the suite everyone already runs. Numbered 00 so it is the first
# thing anyone sees.
#
# WHAT IT CATCHES
#
# Assertions that pin the WHOLE SHAPE of a shared, extensible artifact —
# heading counts, key sets, table sizes, "exactly N ledgers", and literal values
# of tunable constants. Each one forbids every later package from extending the
# thing it counts, so a package doing exactly what it was mandated to do turns a
# done sibling red. Assert your own package's CONTRIBUTION, or a floor.
#
# THE ESCAPE HATCH IS DELIBERATE
#
# Some pins are genuinely intentional. Rather than let those erode the check,
# mark the line:
#
#     is(scalar @things, 4, '...');   # shape-lint: intentional — <reason>
#
# The marker requires a WRITTEN REASON on the same line. That is the whole
# point: a deliberate pin should cost one sentence of justification, and an
# accidental one should cost a failing test.
#
# THIS IS A FLOOR, NOT A CEILING. The lint is a heuristic over English prose and
# it has already missed a real case (decision-context-split.t said "ids", not "headings"). Passing
# here means "no KNOWN shape-pin pattern", never "this oracle is well-formed".

    # only when it happened to fall on the window's LAST line. A correctly
