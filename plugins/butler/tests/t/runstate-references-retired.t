# NEW oracle for blueprint butler-gate-ergonomics package 03-retire-runstate,
# spec §3 (the executable-reference detector, exact specification) and §4
# B15/B16, AC-2/AC-3.
#
# Derived ONLY from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/butler-gate-ergonomics/specs/03-retire-runstate-spec.md
# section 3 -- NOT from bp-runstate.pl's own implementation (which this
# package deletes) and not from any of the files this detector scans.
#
# WRITTEN BLIND TO ANY IMPLEMENTATION. bp-runstate.pl still exists on disk as
# this file is written, and it is referenced from bp-watch.pl, bp-worker.pl,
# guard-ask-operator.sh, bp-continuity.pl, three SKILL.md files, and several
# .t files (per spec §2.9's own table). D1/D2 below are therefore EXPECTED
# to report many hits until the implementer migrates every one of those
# callers off and deletes the file. That is the correct, non-vacuous,
# blind-oracle failure: this file asserts a PROPERTY of the tree (zero
# executable references), not a specific migration mechanism.
#
# ===========================================================================
# A NOTED SPEC INCONSISTENCY (recorded here AND in this package's test-writer
# report, per this task's own instruction to report rather than invent):
# spec §3.3's counter-fixture table claims D2 (§3.2's pattern,
# `m{scripts/bp-runstate\.pl} || m{BpRunState::}`, literally as given) fires
# ("1 hit") on the fixture `require "$DIR/bp-runstate.pl";`. Run literally,
# it does not -- that fixture string contains neither the substring
# "scripts/bp-runstate.pl" (no "scripts/" segment precedes "bp-runstate.pl"
# in "$DIR/bp-runstate.pl") nor "BpRunState::". This file implements the
# REGEX exactly as given in the spec's own code block (§3.2), because that
# code block is unambiguous and its "scripts/" qualifier is load-bearing
# elsewhere in the very same section: it is what distinguishes a resolved-
# path CALLER from a bare-name absence assertion like
# `unlike($code, qr/bp-runstate\.pl/, ...)`, which §3.2's prose explicitly
# and repeatedly says must NOT be flagged. Broadening the pattern to bare
# "bp-runstate\.pl" (which WOULD satisfy the table's row-1 claim) would
# flag every such `unlike(...)` assertion across the suite instead --
# directly contradicting that explicit, emphasized rule. So the counter-
# fixture assertions below follow the LITERAL regex, not the table's row-1
# count, and say so at that specific assertion.
