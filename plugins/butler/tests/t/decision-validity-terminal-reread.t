# e04-honest-terminal-reporting, AC3 (-> DC3): a decision must never be queued
# against a package whose re-read-under-lock ledger status is already
# 'done'/'dropped'. a01 already ships the re-read-under-lock GATE mechanism
# (BpOrch::queue_needs_you, %BpOrch::DECISION_VALIDITY) -- but today the table
# lists ONLY 'stuck-package'. Spec §2.3/§3(3)/§4 AC3/§7 edge case 3 requires
# extending it (zero new code) to also cover judge-starved, turn-starved,
# harvest-failure, harvest-spawn-failure.
#
# TODAY'S WRONG REPORT (confirmed live by reading bp-orchestrator.pl:87 --
# `our %DECISION_VALIDITY = ( 'stuck-package' => ['done', 'dropped'] );` --
# and :1467-1472's default-permit fallthrough for any kind not in the table):
# a judge-starved (or turn-starved/harvest-failure/harvest-spawn-failure)
# decision queued against a package whose ledger ALREADY reads status: done
# is written anyway -- the exact terminal-race techcontas #3 describes, just
# for kinds a01's gate does not yet cover.
#
# Written BLIND to the eventual fix's shape (only the table's CURRENT single
# entry is known; no assumption about how the extension is implemented beyond
# "the table gains more keys, gate mechanism itself unchanged").
#
# VACUITY GUARDS:
#   - every refusal assertion pairs `ret` falsy with "no file appears in
#     escalations/" AND a write_guard log-line check -- an implementation that
#     returns 0 without actually refusing the write (e.g. a bug that logs
#     nothing) is still caught by the escalations/ emptiness check.
#   - a POSITIVE control per kind (status=pending, same kind) proves the gate
#     is not simply refusing everything -- pairs with the negative case so a
#     "refuse unconditionally" bug fails the control instead of hiding behind
#     an always-refuse implementation.
#   - `stuck-package` itself is re-asserted here (already gated by a01) as a
#     control that the table's PRE-EXISTING row is not disturbed by the
#     extension -- catches an implementer who replaces rather than extends
#     the table.
#   - `dag-stalled` is asserted to remain UNGATED (default-permit) even
#     against a done/dropped-status package -- spec §2.3 "Excluded,
#     deliberately" -- catching an over-broad extension that gates pseudo-
#     package kinds it should not.

# `judge-starved` is DELIBERATELY ABSENT from this list, and from %DECISION_VALIDITY
# -- but NOT because it cannot race. Both of its emission sites sit inside guards
# that check the ledger status against a once-per-tick SNAPSHOT (`$jstate eq
# 'starved' && $st eq 'done'`, bp-orchestrator.pl ~:2933/:2998), and a concurrent
# `bp-answer-decision.pl` can flip the LIVE ledger after that snapshot but before
# either branch runs (fixbatch step7 / red-team MAJOR: the "cannot structurally
# fire under any other status" claim was true only of the stale snapshot, not the
# live ledger -- the race was real). Adding a ['done','dropped'] row here would
# still be the wrong fix regardless: it would refuse the kind UNCONDITIONALLY
# (every judge-starved call site is already snapshot-gated to 'done'), converting
# this table's rule ("never queue against an already-terminal package") into
# "never queue this kind at all" -- and it regresses must-stay-green
# plugins/butler/tests/t/write-guard-sites.t's own S4/AC14 control, which pins
# that an unmoved 'done' state (the ORDINARY case: status genuinely still 'done'
# while the harvest audit is unresolved, not a race) still queues judge-starved.
# The actual fix closes the race at its source instead: `_judge_outcome_still_
# applies` (bp-orchestrator.pl) now re-reads the ledger's live status, under the
# ledger's own lock, immediately before either branch commits to queuing --
# a01's re-read-under-the-lock convention, applied to the resource this gate was
# missing. The omission from this table is asserted positively below rather than
# left implicit.
