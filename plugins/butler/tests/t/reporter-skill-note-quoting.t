# skills/reporter/SKILL.md shows `--note "<guidance>"` inline (lines ~112, ~128
# at scout time); a backticked example inside a double-quoted shell argument is
# command-substituted BEFORE the script ever sees it, silently delivering a
# mandate with a hole in it. Spec §2.8 / AC-10.
#
# WRITTEN BLIND TO THE IMPLEMENTATION. Static-text assertions only; no script is
# invoked. Every "must be present" assertion below is expected to FAIL against
# the pre-change tree: today the file has no `<<'EOF'` heredoc form binding
# --note at all, and DOES have at least one bare inline `--note "<...>"` example.
