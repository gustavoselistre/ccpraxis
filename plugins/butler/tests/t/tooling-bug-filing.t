# Spec: .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/butler-and-dashboard-overhaul/specs/

#
# Written from the spec, blind to any prose the implementer will add to
# reporter/SKILL.md, drive-solo/SKILL.md or coordinator-protocol/SKILL.md.
# The heading names/positions asserted below are dictated verbatim by the
# spec (SS3.3, AC1-AC6), not read off a draft.
#
# THE BAR (spec, "read this before writing a single assertion"): a trigger
# that is implemented must be EXERCISED, not asserted by string presence
# alone. AC7 and AC10 below really call
# plugins/almanac/scripts/almanac-bug.pl against a File::Temp tempdir
# (never the real project), file a real report, resolve a real marker to
# it, and separately prove a forged/missing id and a malformed marker are
# REJECTED by the same check. The marker parser is written HERE, in the
# oracle itself (spec SS2: "a test-local check ... no new script"),
# mirroring the fence-scoped, section-scoped extraction
# plugins/butler/scripts/bp-judge.pl:639-674 already uses for
# MEANS-DEVIATION -- same family of marker, same integrity rule.
#
# AC11/AC12 are deliberately NOT covered here: both require
# .ccpraxis-local-data/ state (a filed backlog report; a package ledger's
# Scope section), and that tree is gitignored -- an oracle that asserted
# it would pass only on this machine, on this run. See the step-3 report.
# AC13 (full-suite baseline) is a pipeline procedure, not a single-file
# assertion. AC14/AC15 are hermeticity PROPERTIES OF THIS FILE, self-
# checked below rather than asserted against an implementation.

# heading_pos($text, '## Foo') -> byte offset of that ATX heading as a real
# heading (start of line, nothing after it but whitespace), or -1.
#
# ADDED 2026-08-14 by driver adjudication. Every scan below originally used a
# bare index($text, '## Foo'), which matches the string ANYWHERE -- including
# inside ordinary backticked prose that merely NAMES a heading. That is not a
# hypothetical: coordinator-protocol/SKILL.md legitimately mentions `## Pipeline`
# twice in running text, once inside a list enumerating literal section names.
# index() found the prose mention first, the scan failed, and the implementer
# reasonably reworded the DOCUMENTATION to get the test green -- leaving one
# item in a list of headings formatted unlike its siblings, i.e. the prose got
# worse to suit the oracle.
#
# That is defect shape #5 in this run's catalogue: a malformed oracle shaping
# production code. It already put grep-based workarounds into a live hook once
# (t/142 -> the old mark-wakeup hook). The fix belongs in the scan, not in the prose: a
# heading is a line, so match it as one.
# FIX-BATCH (step 7, F5): the version above (driver, 64105de) anchored a
# heading to its own physical line but had two remaining gaps, both found by
# red-team M2/L3 and both currently non-triggering in committed content
# (confirmed by grep before this fix), which is luck rather than design:
#   - no fence-awareness: a line that LOOKS like a heading inside a fenced
#     example block still counted as a real one.
#   - CRLF/BOM fragility: a trailing \r before the line-end anchor, or a BOM
#     as the literal first three bytes of the file, made a real heading on
#     that line invisible.
# Fixed by scanning line-by-line via byte offsets (never split(), which loses
# separator length and would desync the returned offset), toggling a fence
# flag exactly like parse_tooling_bug_filed's marker scan below, stripping a
# trailing \r before matching, and skipping a leading UTF-8 BOM for matching
# purposes only -- the returned offset always indexes the ORIGINAL $text.

# 20260814-093030-2d3f, for test file numbers) silently hid every marker
# after the first occurrence: a false negative directly threatening Done
# Criterion 5 ("nothing double-files"), since a worker whose genuine marker
# silently fails to register has every incentive to re-file. DECIDED: union
# ALL occurrences rather than reject the ledger outright -- a marker in ANY
# occurrence of the structurally-mandated heading is a real filing, and

# indented code block, distinct from a normal ledger bullet which starts at

# (`plugins/almanac/scripts/almanac-bug.pl:195-200`:
# `\d{8}-\d{6}-[0-9a-f]{4}`) -- no `/`, `\`, or `.` can ever pass, so

# report" -- was accepted by a bare `-f` as a fully resolved filing, even
