# guard-git-mutations.sh greps the WHOLE command STRING (:48, :56), so prose that
# merely QUOTES/mentions "git stash" or "git reset --hard" inside e.g. a
# `--text "..."` argument is blocked exactly like a real invocation. Spec §2.7 /
# AC-16..AC-20.
#
# THIS HOOK IS NOT GATED. It is registered in .claude/settings.json and guards
# THIS driving session's own git calls right now (t/61 C5b guards that
# registration). This file invokes it ONLY as a subprocess with crafted
# payloads on stdin -- it never touches this session's real git state, and every
# invocation below is fully self-contained (its own tempdir, its own env).
#
# WRITTEN BLIND TO THE IMPLEMENTATION. AC-16 (the reported case: a --text
# argument merely quoting "git stash") is expected to FAIL against the
# pre-change tree -- today the raw-string grep denies it. Every AC-17/18/19/20
# case is a "must still behave exactly as today" regression guard and is
# expected to PASS unchanged (both hooks pre- and post-fix must deny/allow these
# identically, per spec §5.1's self-affecting-hook containment).
