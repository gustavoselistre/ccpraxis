#
# WHY THIS TEST EXISTS
#
# Eleven of eleven dispatched review workers died having written NOTHING, and
# each returned its last narration as its "result" -- which reads exactly like a
# finished agent reporting no findings. ~800-900k subagent tokens, zero output,
# and the failure mode is INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM SUCCESS.
#
# The cause was not a platform ceiling. It was `maxTurns:` in each agent's own
# frontmatter: bp-reviewer 20 (dispatched 7x), bp-redteam 25 (4x). The observed
# 20-34 tool-call death band IS those two numbers.
#
# THIS WAS DIAGNOSED ONCE ALREADY AND MIS-FIXED. b23 (2dced1e) raised the LEDGER
# `max_turns:` default 80 -> 150 and wrote into authoring-protocol/SKILL.md that
# "bp-scout/other haiku-model dispatches specifically default 40", citing "three
# coordinators losing EVERY bp-scout dispatch to haiku's old 15-turn cap".
# `git show 2dced1e --stat -- 'plugins/*/agents/'` is EMPTY. bp-scout.md still
# carried `maxTurns: 15` -- the exact number that prose calls known-starving --
# from its original commit, never touched.
#
# Two fields, one concept, names differing only in case and separator:
#   ledger `max_turns:`        -> headless `claude -p` coordinators, bp-launch.sh
#   agent frontmatter `maxTurns:` -> Task subagents
# The remedy went to the field that shares the concept but not the mechanism.
# That is precisely what assertion group C2 below exists to make impossible to
# repeat: it reads the floor from the protocol and enforces it on the AGENT
# FILES, so prose and mechanism can never drift apart again silently.
#
# NO SHAPE PINS. The floor is READ FROM THE PROTOCOL TEXT, never hardcoded here,
# and the agent set is discovered by glob and asserted with `>=` -- adding an
# agent or raising a cap must never turn this red. (t/oracle-hygiene.t.)
