# t/160 — regression coverage for BpState.pm
# added in the s01-status-read-api fix-batch step 7, for two defects that
# survived to step 6 without t/159 (the immutable oracle) catching them:
#
#   M1 — norm_pkg_status/norm_bp_status word-scanned for the FIRST matching
#        status word instead of matching the whole normalised value, so a
#        NEGATED value like 'not-done' resolved to the terminal 'done'
#        (the exact inverse of this blueprint's Decision 6: uncertainty
#        must resolve toward LIVE, never toward settled).
#   M2 — all_package_statuses's extension/lock-exclusion matches were
#        case-sensitive, so a '.MD' ledger was silently dropped on
#        Windows' case-insensitive filesystem, and a '.LOCK' file would be
#        wrongly counted as a package.
#
# This file is NOT the oracle (t/159 is); it exists specifically to make
# these two defects impossible to reintroduce silently. Each test below was
# verified by the fix-batch worker to FAIL against the pre-fix BpState.pm
# and PASS after — see the fix-batch report.
