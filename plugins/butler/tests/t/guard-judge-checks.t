# 121 — oracle for guard-judge-checks.sh (h01 spec §2.2,
# done criterion 6, AC6).
#
# THE RULE THIS MECHANISES. bp-harvest-judge.md's own Method already says a
# declared `checks:` entry is verified "via a declared artefact, never by
# re-running them" — and all three judge runs in the 2026-08-11 GSA fleet
# incident re-ran `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run build` and `pnpm test` anyway
# (sources/2026-08-11-gsa-fleet-collapse.md:125). A second, independent
# instance of prose failing to bind in the SAME incident. This hook makes it
# mechanical.
#
# DELIBERATELY NARROW — per the spec's own out-of-scope section (§6). This is
# NOT a general "declared artefact" verifier: it refuses exactly the
# pnpm/npm/yarn (run)? lint|build|test shape named in the incident evidence,
# and ONLY when BP_ROLE=harvest-judge (the rule exists nowhere else). Do not
# read the assertions below as demanding broader coverage — the spec never
# promised it, and asserting that would invent behavior it does not state.
#
# jq AVAILABILITY. bp_hook_require_jq (lib.sh) hard-fails closed when jq is
# absent — deliberately, because this hook is designed to run only inside the
# judge's sandboxed claude -p, where jq is guaranteed. jq does NOT exist on
# this Windows host (confirmed: `command -v jq` -> not found), so the
# regex-matching assertions (which require jq to read tool_input.command) are
# gated behind a runtime check and SKIPped on a jq-less host rather than
# asserted incorrectly — that would fail for an infrastructure reason, not a
# missing-behavior reason, which is exactly the false-negative this suite
# must avoid. The fail-closed behavior itself (K section) is asserted
# unconditionally on either host, because it must hold on both.
#
# Runs standalone: perl this file
