# Oracle for pause_keepawake_phase() in bp-drive-next.pl: how far ahead a usage
# pause may resume and still justify holding the machine awake for it.
#
# THE DEFECT, measured on the host 2026-09-18. Holding the wake-lock across a
# pause is a promise about resuming -- the machine has to still be awake when the
# usage window reopens, which is why 'pause-pending' is one of the two phases
# should_be_on() holds for. That is sound for the FIVE-HOUR window, which cannot
# reopen more than five hours out. It is not sound for the SEVEN-DAY window: the
# governor returned
#   {"action":"pause","reason":"usage","until_epoch":1790013600}
# with seven_day at 86%, resetting 2026-09-21T18:00Z -- 88 hours away. The old
# unconditional mapping would have held a laptop awake from Friday morning to
# Monday evening waiting for it.
#
# THE ACTION MUST NOT CHANGE. This decides only whether the machine is held
# awake. Anything consuming the director's JSON -- stop-gate.sh,
# the watchdog logic, the reporter -- must see byte-identical output either way, so
# AC-4 pins that rather than trusting it.
