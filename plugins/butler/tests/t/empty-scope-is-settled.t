# Two writer/reader defects that together let the director ask an UNANSWERABLE
# question and then block the driver's stop on it. Both observed live on
# 2026-08-25, on this machine, in that order.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PART 1 (reader) — need-order over ZERO candidates.
#
# `_cmd_next`'s B2 branch fires whenever no order is recorded, and it emits
#     {"action":"need-order","candidates":[...]}
# with whatever `resolve_scope` returned -- INCLUDING the empty list. That
# prompt cannot be answered: `record-order` refuses an empty argument list
# ("at least one blueprint name required"), so the session has no way to
# satisfy it, and every subsequent `next` re-emits it.
#
# It is not merely a stall. stop-gate.sh allows a driver's turn to end
# only for action `done` or `pause`; `need-order` is neither, so the stop is
# BLOCKED and the driver is told to "do the next thing NOW" over zero
# blueprints. Meanwhile B2 calls keepawake_apply('active'), holding the
# machine awake for a run that contains no work at all.
#
# Reproduced exactly: blueprints/ held only _archive/, so @candidates was
# empty, and the driver could not end its turn.
#
# The correct report is `done` -- "every in-scope blueprint is done-or-parked"
# is vacuously true of an empty scope -- together with keep-awake SETTLED.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PART 2 (writer) — record-order persists anything, including a flag.
#
# `_cmd_record_order` validates OMISSIONS exhaustively (it refuses an order
# that drops a blueprint still holding non-terminal packages) and validated
# INCLUSIONS not at all. Every element of @argv was written straight into
# order.json as a blueprint name.
#
# This machine's real order.json, written by an earlier session:
#     {"order":["--order","tui-operator-feedback"],"recorded_at":1787159942}
#
# The failure is SILENT, which is why it survived: the B3 walk looks for a
# blueprint literally named "--order", finds no blueprint.md, and
# blueprint_settled({},{},0) is trivially TRUE -- so the bogus entry reports
# itself settled and the walk moves on. That is the same false-settled class
# t/130 fixed from the READER side (pruning dead names out of order.json);
# this is the WRITER side, which is how the dead name got in.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# VACUITY GUARDS
#   * Part 1 pairs the empty-scope assertion with a POSITIVE control: a scope
#     holding one genuinely pending blueprint must STILL produce need-order.
#     A fix that returns `done` unconditionally passes the first and fails the
#     control.
#   * Part 1 asserts keep-awake was actuated as SETTLED, not merely that the
#     action string changed -- an implementation that reports done while
#     leaving the machine awake fixes the gate and not the defect.
#   * Part 2 pairs its rejection assertion with a POSITIVE control: a real
#     blueprint name must still be accepted and written. It also asserts
#     order.json was NOT created by the rejected call, so "refuse" means
#     refuse rather than warn-and-write.

# A MISSING blueprints/ directory is deliberately NOT an empty scope: it is a

# hide that. An EMPTY blueprints/ (P1a) is a genuine answer to a
# correctly-resolved root; an ABSENT one is a question about the root itself.
#
# Pinned here because the two look identical from inside `_cmd_next` -- both
# yield zero candidates -- and the natural over-generalisation of P1a's fix is
# to swallow this error too.

# PART 1b2 - MALFORMED IS NOT EMPTY, and this is the dangerous direction.
#
# Candidate discovery requires blueprint.md, so a directory under blueprints/
# that HAS package ledgers but no blueprint.md is silently skipped and arrives
# at the empty-scope branch looking exactly like "nothing is there".
#
# Reporting `done` over it is a FALSE-SETTLED bug, not a cosmetic one:
# the watchdog logic treats `done` as absolute ("The director reports no remaining
# work. Do not re-arm."), so a ledger sitting at status: running would be
# declared settled and the run's dead-man's switch disarmed on top of it.
# the retired drive-loop-watchdog coverage's own fixture is precisely this shape -- packages/p1.md with
# no blueprint.md -- and it went red the moment the empty-scope fix landed
# without this distinction. Pinned here so the two cases can never re-merge.
