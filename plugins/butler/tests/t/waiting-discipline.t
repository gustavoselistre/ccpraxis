# b14 oracle. Derived ONLY from

# section 3 (C1..C6) and its vacuity gate.
#
# WRITTEN BLIND TO THE GUIDANCE THIS PACKAGE WILL ADD. As of authoring, coordinator-protocol/
# SKILL.md, plugins/butler/templates/dispatch-prompt.md, judge-harvest.md and judge-resolve.md
# carry NONE of the positive waiting pattern this spec mandates (spec Sec.0: 0 case-sensitive hits
# for the awaiting vocabulary in the protocol; the templates carry none of the pattern language
# either). Every assertion below is expected to fail on MISSING GUIDANCE -- a substring not found,
# or a vocabulary count of 0 where > 0 is required -- never on a Perl exception or a bad path. This
# is a doc-conformance test, not a behavioural one: there is no subprocess, no hook invocation, no
# fixture synthesis -- just Test::More assertions over the literal text of four files read from
# disk.
#
# THIS FILE DOES NOT ASSERT THE EXACT WORDING of the guidance-to-be-written (spec 2 gives content
# to convey, not verbatim sentences to match) -- except where the spec itself gives a concrete,
# load-bearing number (the "160s / one turn" vs "96 turns of a 100-turn budget" arithmetic in
# Sec.2.2, and the C6 vocabulary list, which IS the mandated regex from Sec.0/Sec.3 C6, copied
# verbatim). Everything else is asserted as content-bearing substrings/patterns naming the specific
# instruction (per the vacuity gate: SUBSTANCE, not a heading), never a bare "some string exists
# somewhere".
#
# VACUITY GATE (spec Sec.3, restated here because it is why this file is shaped the way it is):
#   * C1 and C4 assert on the SUBSTANCE of the instruction (background->end turn->resume; the
#     named prohibited shapes; "check once, never in a loop"), not merely that a "## Waiting"
#     heading exists.
#   * C3 is PER-FILE: three separate assertion groups, one per file (dispatch-prompt.md,
#     judge-harvest.md, judge-resolve.md). An aggregate "the pattern appears somewhere in
#     templates/" would pass with two of the three files untouched; this file names each file it
#     reads and fails independently per file.
#   * C6 counts the awaiting vocabulary ONLY in coordinator-protocol/SKILL.md, using the EXACT
#     case-sensitive alternation from spec Sec.0/Sec.3
#     (background|run_in_background|TaskOutput|poll|wait|Monitor|sleep). A repo-wide count would
#     be satisfied today by b15's ALREADY-SHIPPED wait-shape-guard.sh (which itself contains most
#     of this vocabulary) without coordinator-protocol/SKILL.md changing at all -- that would make
#     the oracle worthless. This file greps ONLY the one path named in BP_SKILL below.
#
# HARNESS NOTES:
#   * done_testing(), not a hardcoded plan (project convention; a hardcoded plan that drifts from
#     the assertion count fails with ZERO not-ok lines, which is its own landmine -- see the
#     project CLAUDE.md and t/67's header for the precedent this file follows).
#   * Every assertion NAMES THE FILE it read, in the test description, so a reviewer can see what
#     was actually checked without re-deriving it.
#   * Read-only: this file never writes to any of the four subject files, never touches git.
