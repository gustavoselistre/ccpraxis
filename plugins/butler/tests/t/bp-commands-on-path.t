#!/usr/bin/env perl
# platform: any
# Oracle for blueprint butler-gate-ergonomics, package 04-bp-on-path.
# Derived from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/butler-gate-ergonomics/specs/04-bp-on-path-spec.md
#
# AC1 four new shims exist under plugins/butler/bin/, executable, and
#     structurally match bp-continuity.sh's shape (BASH_SOURCE resolution,
#     missing-script diagnostic, `exec perl ... "$@"` tail).
# AC2 each shim's stdout+exit code byte-match the direct
#     `perl plugins/butler/scripts/<name>.pl` invocation, for one cheap
#     read-only verb per script.
# AC3 a shim invoked via its absolute path from an unrelated cwd still
#     resolves (BASH_SOURCE-based, not cwd-relative).
# AC4 `_install-bin-helper.pl` PATH wiring is idempotent -- applying twice
#     does not duplicate a PATH entry.
# AC5 nothing in the touched files writes to a PATH-shaped file/profile/
#     registry directly -- only ever reaches scripts/_install-bin-helper.pl.
# AC6 plugins/backpack/tests/t/bin-dirs-validation.t and bin-dirs-security.t
#     are pre-existing regression guards (test_paths), unmodified here -- run
#     them separately post-implementation. No assertions for AC6 live in this
#     file by design (see package instructions: do not edit those files).
# AC7 a sandbox-shaped fixture -- bin/+scripts/ copied to a throwaway tempdir
#     at a different absolute path than this repo -- proves the shim does
#     not hardcode any host-specific path (the c724d0d regression).
#
# SAFETY NOTE ON AC4. This host's perl reports $^O eq 'cygwin', so
# _install-bin-helper.pl's `apply` mode would write to the REAL Windows User
# PATH registry via powershell.exe -- exactly what the blueprint's BINDING
# SAFETY CONSTRAINT (and the user-global CLAUDE.md "Modifying the Windows
# User PATH" section) forbid an unattended process from touching. This file
# therefore never invokes the helper's real Windows registry branch. Instead
# it exercises the file-based `run_unix` branch END TO END (real appends,
# real "already present" detection, real idempotency check) by `do`-ing the
# helper script with $^O and $ENV{HOME} both locally overridden to an
# isolated tempdir -- never touching this host's real PATH by any path. See
# the AC4 block below for the full reasoning.
#
# THIS IS A HEAD-run: every assertion below is expected to be RED right now.
# None of plugins/butler/bin/bp-drive-next.sh, bp-ledger.sh, bp-watch.sh,
# bp-dispatch-log.sh exist yet.
