# THE FAILURE THIS FILE IS WRITTEN AGAINST. Two pre-existing suites --
# plugins/sandbox/tests/t/settings-scope-split.t and the old, now-retired
# subagent-stall-guard coverage -- assert only that a
# command STRING appears inside .claude/settings.json's JSON structure. Both
# stayed green while the old separate headless-background and judge-checks
# Bash guards were registered on a route ($CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR-relative, in ccpraxis's own
# tracked settings.json) that cannot reach any other project on this machine
# -- the exact incident (2026-08-11 GSA fleet collapse) that motivated
# the old judge-checks guard happened in a project this registration never
# touched. "A path string appears in a file" is not evidence a hook runs
# anywhere. This file never asserts that. Every block below either (a) runs
# the hook script itself from a directory that is demonstrably not ccpraxis,
# with environment values that simulate a foreign project being driven, or
# (b) proves the OLD dead route is still dead, so the fix cannot be "add a
# second redundant live path" dressed up as a repair.
#
# WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT PROVE (state it plainly, per the driver's
# instruction, rather than imply more than is shown). It does NOT launch a
# real `claude -p` session against a foreign project and observe Claude
# Code's own hook dispatch pick up hooks.json's entries -- no such harness
# exists in this repo (spec §6, explicitly out of scope: "testing Claude
# Code's own hook dispatch, not this package's code"). What it DOES prove is
# the necessary condition the fix depends on and the scout already proved at
# the mechanism level: the old separate headless-background and judge-checks Bash guards,
# invoked by absolute path, are cwd-independent and
# $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR-independent -- their verdict is a pure function of the
# process environment (BP_LEDGER/BP_ROLE), never of where they are called
# from or what project is nominally "current". That independence is exactly
# what makes routing them through ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} (hooks.json, resolved
# machine-wide via the live install regardless of driven project -- proven at
# the mechanism level in scout-step1.md item 1) sufficient to reach a foreign
# project: whatever invokes the script correctly, the script itself will not
# refuse to act just because the cwd or CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is foreign. If a
# future change made either script SILENTLY EXIT 0 on unrecognised cwd or
# unset CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, this file goes red; today, before g02's edit, it
# is already green (the scripts have always been environment-pure) -- so this
# file's contribution is not "goes red before the fix, green after" but
# "pins the necessary condition and makes any future regression of it
# visible", complementing 141 (which pins the registration-route half that IS
# red before the fix).
