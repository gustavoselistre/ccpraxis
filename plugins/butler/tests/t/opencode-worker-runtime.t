# §3, acceptance criteria E1..E14 (mapped 1:1 to DC-1..DC-14, see the spec's own mapping table).
#
# WRITTEN BLIND TO ANY IMPLEMENTATION. plugins/butler/opencode/ does not exist at the time this
# file was authored; the Containerfile has no opencode install; bp-worker.pl has no JSON
# return-contract parsing and no --turn-budget option. Every assertion below that depends on any
# of that is expected to fail on MISSING BEHAVIOUR.
#
# Exceptions, called out explicitly (not silently):
#   * E4/E5 exercise hooks/guard-writes.sh directly -- that script ALREADY SHIPPED (b34 does not
#     reimplement it; it wraps it from a JS plugin). These are expected to PASS now: they are a
#     regression fence for the enforcer the new guard plugin must shell out to unchanged.
#   * E10 requires the real `opencode` binary. It IS installed in this container right now (a
#     coordinator measurement artifact, not yet Containerfile-baked) -- SKIP is not expected to
#     fire; the test runs for real and the report records what it observed.
#   * E11 requires both `opencode` and bp-jail.pl. Both are present, so it also runs for real. The
#     currently-installed opencode resolves under /usr/local (a pnpm store target), and b33's own
#     farm comment explicitly EXCLUDES /usr/local from the `cp -al /usr` skeleton (documented at
#     the "Only /usr/{bin,sbin,lib,lib64} are farmed" comment in bp-jail.pl) -- so this criterion is
#     expected to demonstrate the real gap the spec's §1.2 "lands under /usr" claim glosses over.
#   * E13 asserts invariants that were already true after b33 (nothing needs to cross); expected to
#     PASS now, as a regression fence, not as evidence of b34 work.
#
# HARNESS RULES (mirroring 79/80):
#   * %CLEAN_ENV strips every ambient BP_*/PATH-adjacent var this suite controls explicitly.
#   * All fixtures live under File::Temp / a tempdir rooted at /root (overlayfs, chmod honoured --
#     matches t/worker-jail-isolation.t's TEST_BASE rationale). Nothing is written into the live /project tree.
#   * Any invocation of the real `opencode` binary or bp-jail.pl is wrapped in `timeout` -- no
#     assertion depends on it finishing; a hang must not hang this suite.
#   * done_testing(), not a hand-counted plan.
#   * grep -a (not grep) wherever this file's own harness scans jail trees for text, per project
#     CLAUDE.md landmine #5 (binary-silent grep).

#
# The taxonomy here used to be binary: `-judge$` was a judge and EVERYTHING ELSE
# was a pipeline worker owing an OpenCode counterpart. That held only while
# butler/agents/ contained nothing but workers and judges, and it silently
# mis-filed the first agent that was neither. bp-feedback-verifier is a GATE: it
# is dispatched by an interactive skill (/butler:feedback), never by a
# coordinator, so porting it to the OpenCode worker backend would be exactly as
# wrong as porting a judge -- there is no coordinator step that would ever call
# it. (blueprint:bp-auditor is the same shape and only escaped this check by
# living in a different plugin.)
#
# So classify into three buckets by a RULE rather than a name list, and keep the
# "exactly seven" contract meaning what it says: the agents the OpenCode tree
# must mirror.

# fork()+exec(); under MSYS fork is emulated with threads and the parent's
