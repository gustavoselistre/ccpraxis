# No test may actuate a real OS wake-lock.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHY THE RULE IT ENFORCES IS NOT THE OBVIOUS ONE.
#
# bp-keepawake.pl's spawn() already refuses when $0 ends in ".t", and the comment
# there says a test therefore cannot leak an immortal helper. That is true only
# for a test that calls the perl directly. IT IS FALSE FOR A SUBPROCESS: a test
# that shells out to `perl butler-continuity.pl arm` hands the decision to a process
# whose own $0 is a .pl, and the guard never fires.
#
# That hole was live and costing real processes. t/runstate-pause-holds-lease.t
# ran `bp-runstate.pl pause`, which calls BpKeepAwake::apply with production
# seams; every run of it started a real keep-awake.ps1 on the host. It looked
# clean only because apply() used to return before the helper had written its pid
# file, so the assertion "a pause never fabricates a lease" was reading an empty
# directory a second too early. Making apply() claim the pid file up front — which
# it had to, to stop a fifteen-helper storm — is what exposed it.
#
# The repo has paid for this class twice already: 52 orphaned helpers holding
# 2.7 GB (2026-08-13), and 53 whose -PidFile pointed into File::Temp fixture
# directories (2026-08-14), which forced a machine restart. CLAUDE.md states the
# rule for launcher.pl; this is the same rule one level over, for a whole family
# of scripts, enforced instead of remembered.
#
# THE RULE. Any .t that so much as NAMES the old continuity CLI, bp-runstate.pl or
# the old continuity gate must set CCPRAXIS_NO_WAKELOCK=1 — the supported opt-out,
# and the only one that survives exec into a child process.
#
# Deliberately blunt: it matches a mention, not an invocation. Distinguishing
# "runs it" from "mentions it in a comment" means parsing perl in a regex, and
# the two false positives that costs are one line each, while the false NEGATIVE
# costs a process that outlives the suite. The asymmetry decides it.
#
# PACKAGE 16 POST-FIX-BATCH STRENGTHENING (Decision 80, blueprint
# hook-continuity-remake). F4 made the flattened stop-gate.sh and
# arm-on-entry.sh hooks (BpHook/StopGate.pm and BpHook/ArmOnEntry.pm) ensure
# the real wake-lock refresher (BpContinuityLease::converge ->
# BpContinuityLease::_spawn_daemon -> keep-awake.ps1) is running -- so those
# four names, and the module that actually holds the lease, join the
# ACTUATORS list below. 25 tests plus GuardHarness.pm had set
# CCPRAXIS_NO_WAKELOCK=1 at BEGIN and then wiped every CCPRAXIS_* variable
# before running a hook, so the wipe silently threw the opt-out away too --
# the sweep that exposed it started REAL BpContinuityLease daemons. Check 2
# below catches that class directly (any CCPRAXIS_* env wipe must keep
# CCPRAXIS_NO_WAKELOCK in the SAME expression), independent of whether the
# file mentions an actuator at all -- a wipe is a hazard on its own, because
# the next line added to the file might be the one that actually runs a hook.
