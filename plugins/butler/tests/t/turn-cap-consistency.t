# b51-turn-cap-single-source oracle.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# A turn cap is defined in TWELVE places under three different field names
# (`max_turns`, `maxTurns`, `steps`) and the copies have drifted three separate
# times, each time silently:
#
#   1. b23 raised the ledger max_turns authoring default 80 -> 150 in prose and
#      never touched plugins/butler/agents/bp-scout.md's `maxTurns: 15`.
#   2. b23 ALSO never touched templates/package-ledger.md, which `git blame`
#      still puts at the ORIGINAL commit's `max_turns: 80` -- so the authoring
#      prose says 150 while the template every package is authored from says 80.
#   3. b49 raised the agent caps and missed the OpenCode `steps:` twins, caught
#      only because t/157 happened to assert that one mirror.
#
# Frontmatter cannot reference a variable, so a literal MUST be physically
# present in each agent file. True single-sourcing is therefore impossible; what
# is achievable is a CANONICAL source plus a guard that makes drift a red suite
# instead of a silent two-month divergence. That is what this file is.
#
# NO SHAPE PINS. Role names and counts come from the config and the glob, never
# from a list here; numeric assertions are floors or equalities against the
# config, never hardcoded values. (t/oracle-hygiene.t.)

# ------------------- C8: script-dir resolution, incl. Windows path shapes ----
#
# THIS EXACT RESOLUTION HAS FAILED THREE TIMES IN THIS REPO, and every failure
# needed a Windows host to observe, so none was ever caught here:
#
#   1. bp-baseline.pl   — a relative dirname made `require` search @INC, killing
#                         both `materialize` and `gate`.
#   2. install-skills.pl — FindBin fell back to the CWD on a backslash $0 and
#                         `apply` DELETED three installed skills.
#   3. bp-turn-caps.pl  — abs_path got a raw `C:\...` path, did not recognise it
#                         as absolute, and pasted the CWD in front:
#                         /c/Users/X/ccpraxis/C:/Users/X/ccpraxis/plugins/...
#
# script_dir_for is pure string/filesystem logic precisely so the Windows shapes
# can be asserted from Linux. A synthetic path is not a simulation of the bug --
# it IS the input that broke, and the assertions below fail on the old code.

# idiom introduced abs_path() calls into three files that never loaded Cwd, and
# `perl -c` does NOT catch it -- an undefined subroutine is a RUNTIME error. Two
# full suite sweeps were needed to find what one assertion states directly.
