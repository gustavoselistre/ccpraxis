# Oracle for blueprint package 06-route-by-marker (blueprint test-platform-split).
# Derived from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/test-platform-split/specs/06-route-by-marker-spec.md
# AND from the package ledger's "STEP 2 GATE" entry
# (.ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/test-platform-split/packages/06-route-by-marker.md),
# which the ledger instructs takes precedence wherever the two disagree. NOT
# derived from any implementation: scripts/run-tests.pl does not yet define
# classify_file/_run_container_batch/_container_infra_result/run_sweep at the
# time this file is written (verified: no such subs, no "unless caller()"
# guard -- confirmed by a plain `grep -n '^sub '` over the real file, never by
# reading its logic), and this file must never add that behaviour itself.
#
# ======================================================================
# WHERE THIS FILE DEPARTS FROM THE SPEC TEXT, AND WHY THE LEDGER WINS
# ======================================================================
# 1. CRITERION 5 IS DEFERRED (ledger Decision 17, STEP 2 GATE, 2026-09-17).
#    The spec's own section 4 ("Criterion 5 -- measurement protocol") and
#    its AC-5 are NOT implemented by anything below, deliberately -- not as
#    a weaker/placeholder assertion, but as NO assertion at all, per this
#    package's explicit rescoping brief: "Criterion 5 (measurably faster)
#    is DEFERRED -- do not write assertions for it, and do not write a
#    placeholder that asserts something weaker in its name."
# 2. DC-6 IS THE LEDGER'S CORRECTED FORM, not the spec's literal text. The
#    spec's own section 0.3 already corrects DC-6 to "(windows-marked
#    files) UNION (serial-classified files, regardless of marker)" and the
#    ledger's STEP 2 GATE entry independently re-derives and pins the same
#    correction ("DC-6 AS LITERALLY WRITTEN IS FALSE"). Both agree here;
#    Part D below asserts the corrected set.
# 3. A REAL, UNRESOLVED CONTRADICTION, flagged rather than silently picked:
#    the spec's own section 7 ("Out of scope") says routing-configurability
#    via "env var/flag to disable container routing" is "explicitly
#    forbidden by the ledger." The ledger's Decision 17/18 (dated the SAME
#    day, 2026-09-17, and recorded in this package's own STEP 2 GATE entry)
#    says the opposite: the container lane must be reachable "by an
#    explicit flag rather than by default," and Decision 18 spells out a
#    lane-AVAILABILITY capability gate ("with the flag off, every file runs
#    on the host as today") that is squarely an "env var/flag" by the
#    spec's own section 7 wording. Per this oracle's brief ("if the spec
#    contradicts the ledger's STEP 2 GATE entry, the ledger wins"), the
#    CAPABILITY GATE'S EXISTENCE is taken as required. Its concrete
#    mechanism (flag name, CLI form, env var) is NOT specified anywhere --
#    neither the spec nor the ledger names one -- so this file does not
#    invent one. What IS both specified and directly testable, and is
#    asserted below (the "Decision 18 purity" block, before Part A), is the
#    interface-agnostic half of Decision 18's own property: "no flag,
#    environment variable or argument can send a windows file to the
#    container or pull an any file back to the host" -- proven by showing
#    classify_file's own source takes exactly one parameter (the file path)
#    and never consults $ENV or @ARGV, so its per-file verdict cannot vary
#    with any external state by construction. STATED PLAINLY SO IT NEEDS NO
#    INFERENCE: the WIRING-level half of Decision 18 -- what run_sweep does
#    with @container when the lane-availability capability is OFF (does it
#    run those files on the host instead? does it use a different result
#    shape than section 2.5's container_infra?) -- IS LEFT COMPLETELY
#    UNPINNED BY THIS ORACLE. Not weakly covered, not implied by another
#    assertion -- UNPINNED. Reason: section 2.2.1 of the spec forbids this
#    file from ever calling run_sweep() (it would either run a real ~1000s
#    sweep in-process or hit a bare exit() that kills the test process), and
#    DC-6's own "enumerate, never sweep" mandate rules out proving it by
#    spawning a real, flag-toggled sweep instead. A reviewer/implementer
#    must treat the capability gate's wiring-level behaviour as an open
#    design question this package still owes an answer to, not as something
#    this file has already checked. Reported as untestable-as-specified
#    rather than invented.
#
# ======================================================================
# THE PRECEDENCE FIGURES THIS FILE'S CASE TABLE AND PART D DEPEND ON --
# MEASURED FROM DISK AT AUTHORING TIME, NEVER FROM scripts/run-tests.pl's
# OWN LOGIC (a fresh `grep -lE` over plugins/*/tests/t/*.t, independent of
# any implementation):
#   350 total .t files; 108 marked windows; 242 marked any; 0 marked linux.
#   15 files match the serial heuristic (TestSandbox|podman_run_capture|
#   podman_bin|probe_image); of those 15, exactly 10 are marked `any` and 5
#   are marked `windows` -- CONFIRMS the spec/ledger's own "10 of 15" claim
#   exactly, re-derived independently rather than trusted.
# Part D re-derives its own expected sets fresh at assertion time and never
# hardcodes these counts (beyond a floor); they are recorded here only as
# the authoring-time evidence for the case table's row 4-6 design and the
# report this file's own header is required to give.
#
# ======================================================================
# WHAT IS EXPECTED TO FAIL TODAY, AND WHY (not a fixture fault):
#   - The safety-gate check ("section 2.2: ... defines run_sweep() and
#     guards ...") is expected to FAIL and BAIL_OUT the rest of this file.
#     scripts/run-tests.pl today executes its entire body -- argv parsing,
#     glob, the real fork/waitpid execution phases, and a bare top-level
#     `exit scalar(@red);` -- merely by being `require`d. Actually
#     `require`ing it today would run a real, unbounded, ~1000s sweep
#     inside THIS process and then hard-exit the whole test process before
#     a single assertion below could run -- exactly the hazard spec section
#     2.2 names and exists to close. This oracle refuses to attempt the
#     real `require` until that structural change is verified present,
#     mirroring container-lane.t's own `ok(-f $IMPL) or BAIL_OUT(...)`
#     idiom for "the file this oracle needs is not yet safe to load."
#   - Consequently EVERY assertion in Parts A, B, C and D, and the AC-4 live
#     subprocess regression guard, currently reports as not-run (BAIL_OUT
#     stops the file before done_testing()) -- this is the correct,
#     expected shape for an oracle whose target module does not yet exist
#     in usable form, identical in kind to container-lane.t's own original
#     all-Parts-unreached state when run-tests-container.pl did not exist.
#     The SELF-CHECK block (before AC-8, described below) exists precisely
#     because that unreached state would otherwise leave Part A's and
#     Part D's own assertion shapes unproven until step 5.
#
# WHAT IS EXPECTED TO PASS TODAY, AND WHY THAT IS NOT VACUOUS:
#   - The SELF-CHECK block, in full: it runs Part A's ten-row case table and
#     Part D's enumeration/is_deeply logic against a SYNTHETIC, require-safe
#     stub (classify_file copied verbatim from spec section 2.1) that this
#     file builds itself under File::Temp -- proving those two blocks'
#     assertions are satisfiable by a correct implementation (the "correct
#     stub" half) AND that they would actually catch a specific, named
#     regression -- an inverted marker-vs-serial precedence -- if one
#     existed (the "mutated stub" half, isnt()-based, never a native
#     is_deeply "not ok"). This is scaffolding this file is entitled to
#     write; it never touches scripts/run-tests.pl and is clearly labelled
#     "SELF-CHECK" in every test name so it cannot be mistaken for a green
#     real-file result. See the dedicated SELF-CHECK header comment below
#     for the full separation statement.
#   - The AC-8 `perl -c` checks (both files already parse as valid Perl).
#   - The AC-1 source-scan (scripts/run-tests.pl's only "backfill" mention
#     today is inside a comment, so the executable-reference count is
#     already 0) -- expected green today, and STAYS green after
#     implementation only because the implementer must not add an
#     executable reference; a regression guard, not a placeholder.
#   - The AC-7 source-scan (no `sub main` exists in scripts/run-tests.pl
#     today at all) -- also a forward-looking regression guard.
#   - The safety-gate check's own counter-fixture proves the detector CAN
#     pass (fed a fabricated already-safe source snippet), so its failure
#     against the real file is a real finding, not a tautology.
#
# ======================================================================
# AC -> block mapping (spec section 5, corrected per the header above):
#   AC-1 (DC-1)  -> "AC-1 source-scan" block (backfill never referenced
#                   executably) + Part A rows 9-10 (backfill-signal-in-body
#                   has no effect on the lane).
#   AC-2 (DC-2)  -> Part D's container-set is_deeply; Part C (opt-in, live).
#   AC-3 (DC-3)  -> Part A rows 4-6 (the collision, generalised) + row 8
#                   (marker-gate-first ordering); Part D's host-serial-set
#                   is_deeply.
#   AC-4 (DC-4)  -> Part A row 7 (classify_file refuses); the "AC-4 live
#                   regression guard" block (real run-tests.pl subprocess).
#   AC-5 (DC-5)  -> DEFERRED. No assertion anywhere in this file (see above).
#   AC-6 (DC-6, scoped) -> Part D's host-parallel-set is_deeply, combined
#                   with AC-3's host-serial-set is_deeply.
#   AC-7 (regression guard) -> "AC-7 source-scan" block (no sub main).
#   AC-8 (regression guard) -> "AC-8: perl -c" block, both files.
#   Decision 18 (lane-availability, not routing) -> "Decision 18 purity"
#                   block, structural, before Part A (see header note 3).
#   SELF-CHECK (step-3 gate addition, bug 20260916-110812-2d94) -> proves
#                   Part A's case table and Part D's enumeration/is_deeply
#                   logic are non-vacuous, against a synthetic stub, BEFORE
#                   the real BAIL_OUT would otherwise leave them unreached.
#
# MANDATORY VACUITY GATE (this blueprint's own standing rule -- a wrong
# implementation has passed a whole oracle here before, with the defect
# living in the oracle rather than the code under test):
#   - Every detector this file defines locally (the backfill-reference
#     scanner, the run_sweep/unless-caller safety-gate scanner, the
#     classify_file-purity extractor) is exercised against a fabricated
#     POSITIVE fixture (proving it fires) as well as being run against the
#     real source (which may or may not fire, depending on implementation
#     state) -- so none of them could pass by never triggering.
#   - The case table's row 4-6 collision and row 9-10 invariance are a
#     matched positive/negative pair by construction: rows 1-3 prove the
#     marker value alone decides when nothing is serial-classified; rows
#     4-6 prove the serial heuristic overrides that same marker value when
#     it fires; rows 9-10 prove a backfill-style signal in the body, absent
#     the serial-heuristic substrings, changes nothing.
#   - Part D's real-tree sweep asserts a floor (>= 300) on the file count
#     it iterates, so it cannot pass by iterating over nothing, and computes
#     its "expected" sets via an INDEPENDENT re-derivation (TestPlatform.pm
#     + the same regex, written out again here) rather than ever comparing
#     classify_file against itself.

# SELF-CHECK -- added per step-3 gate feedback, citing bug
# 20260916-110812-2d94: "five subtests passing is indistinguishable from
# twenty passing unless somebody counts." Parts A and D further below
# CANNOT execute today (scripts/run-tests.pl is not yet require-safe, and
# the BAIL_OUT that stops this file there is correct and stays exactly
# where it is). That leaves those two blocks' own assertions genuinely
# unproven: a typo or a wrong is_deeply shape in either one would sit
# silently in this immutable file until step 5, in a package the
# implementer is forbidden to fix it in.
#
# This block proves those two blocks' ASSERTION SHAPES are live and
# non-vacuous *right now*, by running the identical case-table rows and
# enumeration/is_deeply logic against a SYNTHETIC, require-safe stub this
# file builds itself -- never against scripts/run-tests.pl.
#
# THE STUB'S classify_file IS COPIED VERBATIM FROM SPEC SECTION 2.1 -- not
# improvised, not simplified, not "the same idea." $CLASSIFY_BODY below is
# that exact body, byte-for-byte modulo comment trimming, wrapped in the
# run_sweep()/"exit ... unless caller()" shape section 2.2 requires so the
# stub is require-safe by construction (proving THAT shape is achievable
# too, not asserting it about the real file, which the gate above already
# does correctly).
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# SEPARATION -- stated as plainly as the gate feedback asked for: every
# assertion in this SELF-CHECK section exercises THIS FILE'S OWN
# ASSERTIONS against a stub OF THIS FILE'S OWN CONSTRUCTION. It is NOT,
# and must never be read as, a substitute for Parts A/B/C/D or the AC-4
# guard below, which test the REAL scripts/run-tests.pl and remain gated
# behind the real safety-gate BAIL_OUT, unchanged. A green SELF-CHECK
# proves this oracle WOULD catch the bug it claims to catch; it says
# nothing whatsoever about whether scripts/run-tests.pl exists yet or is
# correct. Every test label in this section is prefixed "SELF-CHECK" for
# exactly this reason -- so a later reader scanning TAP output cannot
# mistake a green self-check line for a green implementation line.
#
# SCOPE: this proves Part A's case table and Part D's enumeration/
# is_deeply logic only -- the two blocks the step-3 gate named, and the
# two most likely to hide a wrong-shape assertion. Part B
# (RunTestsContainerLane hermetic monkeypatches), Part C (opt-in live),
# and the AC-4 live-subprocess guard are NOT re-proven here: they exercise
# interfaces (_run_container_batch, a real subprocess) this self-check
# does not stub, and the gate feedback did not name them.
