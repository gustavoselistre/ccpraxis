#!/usr/bin/env perl
# The oracle for the throwaway, capped run-mode that executes .t files inside
# the EXISTING sandbox image on the container's own overlay filesystem,
# rather than the launcher's bind mount. Spec:
#   .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/test-platform-split/specs/05-container-lane-spec.md
# Ledger done criteria: scripts/run-tests-container.pl (the implementation,
# not yet written when this file is authored) reuses the existing image
# without ever building; passes explicit --cpus/--memory caps; lands the
# tree on the container's own storage, not a bind mount; disposes of every
# container it creates (Decision 14's three separate obligations); preserves
# TAP/exit-code fidelity; and routes every container-side path through
# `sh -c`, never as a bare leading-slash argv element next to a native
# binary -- the MSYS2 rewrite that blinded the sandbox busy-lease probe for
# three weeks (see plugins/sandbox/tests/t/busy-lease-path-conversion.t).
#
# STRUCTURE (mirrors the spec's own Part A/B/C split):
#   Part A -- pure value-level assertions against the builder/rule subs.
#             Zero podman/container cost, zero cost even with no CLI at all.
#   Part B -- podman_bin()/image_present() probes only. Real subprocess,
#             never a container, never a build.
#   Part C -- live, in-container assertions. Opt-in only, behind
#             CCPRAXIS_CONTAINER_LANE_LIVE=1, so no unattended sweep (this
#             file runs under at least three different harnesses with no
#             shared "routine sweep" flag) ever touches podman by accident.
#
# Requiring the implementation file below runs no code beyond constant/sub
# definitions and %SIG/END registration (its own top-level statements are
# constants, use, and sub definitions only, per spec section 2.0) -- so this
# whole file, including Part A and B, costs nothing beyond a --version probe
# even when it runs under a harness with no --fast-equivalent exclusion at
# all (plugins/butler/tests/run-tests.pl).
#
# CLASSIFICATION (why this file is safe to leave un-tagged): calling
# podman_bin() below (Part B) puts the literal substring "podman_bin" in
# this file's own source, genuinely -- not decoratively -- which is what
# scripts/run-tests.pl's classifier keys on to route this file into the
# serial lane, away from the 6-way parallel lane where it would contend
# against one podman machine.
#
# MANDATORY VACUITY GATE (this blueprint's standing rule -- a wrong
# implementation has passed a whole oracle before, with both defects living
# in the oracle, not the code under test):
#   - The bare-leading-slash-outside-"sh -c" detector (criterion 6) is
#     exercised against a fabricated violating line AND a fabricated
#     already-safe line AND the one legitimate exception the spec names
#     (materialize_tree's host-side `exec('git', ...)` call).
#   - The "no quoted 'build' argv literal anywhere" detector (criterion 1)
#     is exercised against a fabricated violating line.
#   - orphan_container_names() carries its own built-in counter-fixture
#     shape: A15 is the case that fires, A16-A20 are five different reasons
#     it must NOT fire, so the rule cannot pass by never triggering.
#   - The A11-A13 sweep over build_extract_argv/build_test_exec_argv demands
#     exactly two arrays were actually swept, so it cannot pass over an
#     empty set.
#
# ORACLE TABLE (spec section 3.1/3.2/3.3), mapped to done criteria:
#   AC1 (reuse, never build)     -> the quoted-'build'-literal scan + its
#                                    counter-fixture, B2 (image_present on a
#                                    bogus tag), and the main()-source-order
#                                    check (image_present before
#                                    build_run_argv).

#                                    C2 (live -- caps actually applied).
#   AC3 (container-native fs)    -> C4/C5 (live, positive-and-negative pair).
#   AC4 (disposal, Decision 14)  -> A23 (handlers installed), C1+C10 (create-

#                                    removes its container), A15-A21 plus the
