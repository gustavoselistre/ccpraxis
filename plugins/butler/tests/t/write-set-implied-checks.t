# THE PROBLEM (external report, techcontas-ux-refine, 13 packages):
# every package verified its own `test_paths` and reported green, and five
# defects still reached the closing gate -- each because the check that would
# have caught it was in NO package's done-criteria. A package's gate answers
# "do my tests pass?"; it needs to answer "is everything my write set can break
# still working?". `test_paths` is a SCOPE LIMITER, not a check list.
#
# THREE OPERATOR-ACCEPTED CORRECTIONS constrain the design, and each has an
# assertion below:
#
#   1 (BLOCKING) The derivation table is PROJECT-SUPPLIED, never plugin-hardcoded.
#     Every row of the reporter's table names a JS/TS/Firebase artefact
#     (tsc --noEmit, Vitest, functions/src/**, Firestore indexes, *.rules).
#     ccpraxis is stack-agnostic and its OWN blueprints are pure Perl, where
#     every row is inapplicable. A project with no table must degrade to today's
#     behaviour, not inherit a foreign stack's checklist.
#
#   2 The harvest judge is contractually confined to its slice ("Do not wander
#     the wider repo"). It therefore cannot verify a check RAN unless the check
#     leaves a DECLARED ARTEFACT that joins that slice.
#
#   3 A declarative `checks:` field that nothing enforces is the same defect as
#     b23's prose-fixed/mechanism-unfixed divergence, wearing a new field name --
#     and worse than no field, because it reads as coverage.
#
# NO SHAPE PINS: no fixed count of check types, no pinned table contents. The
# table is read from a fixture this file builds. (t/oracle-hygiene.t.)
