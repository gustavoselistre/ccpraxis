# 175 -- the hook payload read is BOUNDED.
#
# WHAT THIS PINS. Every butler hook used `PAYLOAD=$(cat)`, an unbounded read.
# With stdin at EOF -- what Claude Code's own hook dispatch produces -- that is
# instant and correct. With stdin an inherited pipe that never closes, `cat`
# blocks FOREVER at essentially no CPU, and nothing upstream notices.
#
# Bug report 20260828-095201-7c1e: a perl.exe running a throwaway probe out of a
# session scratchpad was found alive NINE DAYS after its session had exited,
# having burnt 0.016s of CPU in total -- blocked on a read, holding 11 MB and 135
# handles, orphaned. That report GUESSED the cause was one of five specific
# payloads wedging guard-git-mutations.sh. Replaying its own probe disproves that
# -- all five classify correctly in seconds. The defect is the unbounded read,
# and it was in nine hooks.
#
# WHY A TEST AND NOT JUST THE FIX. The failure mode is invisible: a wedged hook
# produces no output, no error and no CPU. Nothing else in this suite would
# notice the bound being removed, and the natural "simplification" -- putting
# `$(cat)` back because it is shorter -- reintroduces it silently.
#
# EVERY CASE HERE IS BOUNDED BY alarm(). A test for a hang that can itself hang
# is worse than no test: it would wedge the sweep exactly the way the bug wedges
# a session. The FIFO cases hold a writer open deliberately, so the alarm is the
# only thing standing between this file and the nine-day process it describes.
