# 94 — the drive-solo driver's stop discipline.
#
# WHAT IS BEING PROTECTED
#
# /butler:drive-solo casts the driver as "a thin loop over the director": call
# bp-drive-next.pl next, dispatch the action, call next again. That is prose,
# and prose decays over a long context. Observed three times in a single 12-hour
# run on 2026-08-07: a driver turn ended immediately after a ledger write, its
# text promising the next step, with nothing scheduled to perform it. A
# dispatched agent notifies; a finished FOREGROUND Bash call does not. So the
# run died silently, mid-package, LOOKING finished — the worst property an
# unattended run can have, because the operator only discovers it by asking.
#
# gate-stop.sh already makes this argument one level down, for coordinators:
# it "converts ledger discipline from a prompt rule (which decays over long
# contexts) into a mechanical gate". But every butler hook opens with
# bp_hook_gate, which requires BP_LEDGER — exported only into coordinator
# processes. The DRIVER, the one participant nothing supervises, therefore had
# no stop discipline at all.
#
# THE RULE, in one line:
#   A driver turn may end EITHER because something will wake the session,
#   OR because the director says the run is settled. Never otherwise.
#
# The two hooks under test implement it as a pair: mark-wakeup.sh (PreToolUse)
# records that this turn scheduled a wake-up; gate-drive-loop.sh (Stop) consumes
# that marker, and blocks the stop when there is none and the director still
# has work.
#
# POSTURE UNDER TEST. A stop gate that misfires traps a human's session, which
# is strictly worse than the bug it prevents. So the safety properties below
# (bounded blocking, both escape hatches, fail-open, correct scoping) matter at
# least as much as the blocking behaviour itself, and each is asserted.
#
# Runs standalone: perl this file
# (`prove` does not exist on the Git-for-Windows host.) No container, no
# network, no launcher spawn; every fixture lives under File::Temp.
