# 168 -- oracle for t09-guard-hooks-stripping's
# guard-judge-checks.sh changes (spec .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/
# tui-operator-feedback/specs/t09-guard-hooks-stripping-spec.md SS2.2/SS2.3/SS3/SS4).
# Companion to guard-judge-checks.t (that file's own oracle, NOT edited here --
# this package's write set is tests/t/ only, and 121 already pins the pre-existing
# denylist/gate-order behavior this file must not regress; it stays a live baseline).
#
# WRITTEN BLIND TO THE IMPLEMENTATION.
#
# jq AVAILABILITY. guard-judge-checks.sh hard-requires jq for the denylist regex path,
# but its BP_LEDGER/BP_ROLE gate runs BEFORE bp_hook_require_jq (spec SS2.3, "order is
# safety-critical") -- so the gate-order assertions below (AC9) are NOT jq-gated and run
# on any host. The denylist/quote-stripping assertions (AC8) ARE jq-gated and SKIP on
# this jq-less Windows host, matching 121's own documented convention.
#
# TECHNIQUE NOTE (guard evasion). Fixtures reach the hook only as heredoc'd JSON payload
# text this test writes to a pipe (mirroring 121's own `bash "$GUARD" <<'PAYLOAD_EOF'`
# technique) -- never as literal text in a Bash tool_input.command this session issues.
#
# Runs standalone: perl this file

# PATH containing everything on the ambient PATH except jq -- used to prove the gate
# short-circuits BEFORE jq is required (AC9), independent of host jq availability.
# SUBTRACT THE DIRECTORIES THAT CONTAIN jq -- do not mirror every other
# executable into a new one.
#
# This used to build a shadow bin/ by symlinking every executable on PATH (plus
# /usr/bin, /bin, /usr/local/bin) except jq. Measured on this host that is 6401
# symlinks, and it made this the slowest file in the repository by a wide
# margin: 237s, of which ~20s was creating them and ~167s was File::Temp's
# CLEANUP deleting them again at process exit. The teardown dominated because
# File::Path::rmtree is pure Perl walking one entry at a time through the MSYS
# layer -- native `rm -rf` does the same directory in 1.4s. The test body itself
# runs in 13s.
#
# The intent is "a PATH on which jq cannot be found". Removing the directories
# that contain it expresses exactly that, costs one stat per PATH entry instead
# of thousands of symlinks, and creates nothing that has to be cleaned up.
#
# It is also MORE faithful than the mirror was: the mirror silently dropped
# anything that was not a regular executable file (wrappers, shell functions
# exported as scripts, anything unreadable), so the guard ran under a PATH
# subtly unlike the real one. This keeps the real PATH minus jq.
