# §2 (contracts), §3 (behaviours B1..B26), §4 (AC-1..AC-39) and §5 (edge cases E1..E12).

# WRITTEN BLIND TO ANY IMPLEMENTATION. plugins/butler/hooks/ledger-guard.sh does not exist at the
# time this file was authored, and hooks.json carries no ledger-guard entry. Every AC assertion
# below must therefore fail on MISSING BEHAVIOUR (the hook binary is absent -> bash exits 127 with
# a "No such file or directory" message), never on a perl/harness bug of this file. The handful of
# assertions labelled FIXTURE-SANITY: are deliberate harness self-checks and are expected to pass
# even with the hook absent -- they are the evidence that the red below is attributable to the
# missing hook and not to broken scaffolding.
#
# HARNESS RULES (carried over from the spec §4.3 and from the drained step-3 run, not re-derived):
#   * %CLEAN_ENV strips EVERY ambient BP_*. This suite is run BY coordinator sessions that export
#     BP_LEDGER/BP_DIR/BP_PROJECT_ROOT; an inherited value silently turns AC-1 ("inert outside a
#     coordinator session") into a FALSE PASS.
#   * run_hook writes the payload to a temp file and runs `timeout 60 bash "$HOOK" < payload 2>&1`.
#     Invoking via `bash` (never by executing the file directly) means a missing exec bit cannot
#     produce a false red.
#   * done_testing(), NOT a hand-counted `plan tests => N`. A hardcoded plan count is exactly what
#     makes wait-shape-guard.t brittle (:39) and is half of the blocker this package already carries.
#   * ALL fixtures are SYNTHESIZED under File::Temp. No live ledger under
#     .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/*/packages/ is read, and above all none is written -- those
#     are live orchestration state for a running fleet.
#   * Output is captured via a temp file / pipe, never by reopening STDOUT onto an in-memory scalar
#     (Git-for-Windows perl fails there with "Bad file descriptor"; project CLAUDE.md landmine).
#   * Never shell out to rg: ripgrep is .gitignore-aware and returns a FALSE CLEAN for anything
#     under .ccpraxis-local-data/.
#
# NO `use utf8` HERE, DELIBERATELY. Non-ASCII literals below (em dash, ellipsis) are byte strings,
# so JSON::PP emits them as the raw UTF-8 bytes a real ledger carries, and the guard sees bytes --
# matching spec §2.4 ("all regexes are byte regexes") and E12.
#
# RULED DEVIATIONS (settled by the coordinator; recorded here, not re-litigated):
#   * AC-38 ("this file exits 0 with zero not ok") is self-referential and untestable from inside
#     this file. The coordinator judges it. There is deliberately no AC-38 block below.
#   * AC-23: with a CONSTANT new_string and the prefix/\b section patterns of §2.4, a one-of-two
#     context break is reachable only via the frontmatter. The block below therefore breaks the
#     frontmatter `status:` value rather than a `## Outputs` heading. The two BINDING assertions
#     (replace_all=true -> RC 2, byte-identical payload with replace_all=false -> RC 0) are
#     unaffected.
