#!/usr/bin/env perl
# platform: any
# t/113 — a one-shot judge must never be told
# to background its work.
#
# THE BUG THIS PINS. `judge-harvest.md` and `judge-resolve.md` both carried a
# paragraph copied from the interactive coordinator's protocol:
#
#   "if you launch any long-running check, use run_in_background, end your turn,
#    and resume on the completion notification"
#
# For a coordinator that is right — it has a next turn. A judge does not.
# `bp-judge.sh:8` calls it "a fresh headless `claude -p`" and `:14` says
# outright "a judge is one-shot". When such a process ends its turn awaiting a
# background task, the PROCESS EXITS: the notification has nowhere to arrive and
# no verdict is ever written.
#
# The orchestrator then logs `judge_crashed` and parks the package with a
# decision reading "its outputs don't meet the done-criteria" — which is false;
# no judge ever assessed the work. Reported from a live GSA fleet run
# (2026-08-13) with orchestrator.log evidence, after the same package ate the
# same coin-flip twice across two sessions. It had also been filed once before
# and lost, because that report lived in a session scratchpad.
#
# The instruction is only reachable through prose, so prose is where it must be
# pinned — there is no hook that can inspect what a template tells a model.
