# WRITTEN BLIND TO ANY IMPLEMENTATION. The split has not happened: `reports/decisions/SYN-*.md` do
# not exist, and every `| SYN-N | ... |` row is still the full, unsplit original text with no
# `-> reports/decisions/SYN-N.md` pointer. Every C assertion below is expected to fail on MISSING
# BEHAVIOUR (absent files / absent pointer / absent binding statement), never on a bug in this file.
#
# :raw ONLY, throughout. No `use utf8` anywhere in this file — the three non-ASCII bytes this file
# needs to match (em dash, en dash, right arrow) are written as explicit \xNN hex escapes below so
# the source stays plain ASCII and unambiguous regardless of how it round-trips through an editor.
#
# SYN-23: no assertion, fixture or comment in this file cites a line number in blueprint.md,
# bp-orchestrator.pl or bp-blueprint.pl. Everything is located by grep pattern / regex.
#
# MANDATORY VACUITY GATE (spec §5, "deferred-review queue" standing rule): C3, C4 and C7 each have a
# natural negative-only phrasing that passes trivially against a do-nothing implementation. Each
# therefore carries a POSITIVE assertion FIRST, before the negative one:
#   - C3 asserts >=1 citation was actually enumerated across packages/*.md.
#   - C4 asserts parse_dag returned a non-empty result of >=71 packages.
#   - C7 asserts, PER DECISION, that a non-empty binding statement was actually located (i.e. the
#     `-> reports/decisions/SYN-N.md` pointer is present in that row) BEFORE checking what the
#     statement contains. Locating "a binding statement" is defined as finding the pointer — not as
#     "whatever text happens to be in the cell" — because the cell today is the WHOLE original row,
#     which would trivially "contain" its own ruling and make the criterion vacuous pre-split.
#
# No SKIP block appears anywhere in this file. A missing file, a missing pointer, or an unlocatable
# row is always asserted as a FAILURE via a defined empty-string/undef fallback, never skipped.
