# Regression oracle for the 2026-08-13 process storm.
#
# WHAT HAPPENED. The operator had to force-restart the machine: terminals stopped
# responding and the process list held "a zillion" powershell.exe and conhost.exe
# entries. Two defects in bp-keepawake.pl combined to produce it.
#
#   1. ps_available() answered "is powershell resolvable?" by SPAWNING
#      `powershell.exe -Command "exit 0"`. Windows attaches a conhost.exe to each
#      one, so merely ASKING the question cost two process creations.
#
#   2. apply() called that probe BEFORE its idempotence check. So the steady
#      state -- a keep-awake lock already alive, nothing whatsoever to do --
#      still paid the probe on every single call, and _pid_alive's tasklist on
#      top of it.
#
# The Stop hook runs the director on every turn end, so "every call" is a hot
# path, not a rare one.
#
# These assertions pin BOTH halves. They are behavioural where it matters: the
# ordering is proven through apply()'s own injectable seams, not by reading the
# source, because the source can be rearranged while staying wrong.

# to work around), so the unconditional kill is close to a no-op against a
# recycled pid -- while _pid_alive costs the very tasklist spawn this file was
# just fixed to stop paying. t/111 and t/17 both pin the current contract.

# TEST fixture dirs (bp/, bp2/, bp-orphan/, bp-done/). bp-orchestrator.pl calls
# apply() with only a `log` seam -- no `spawn` seam -- so the REAL spawn runs,
# and t/orchestrator-decision-core.t drives that path. Each butler-suite run leaked several
# helpers that then slept forever; repeated runs filled the machine.
#
# Same rule CLAUDE.md already states for launcher.pl, one level over: a test may
# not create an OS process that outlives it.
