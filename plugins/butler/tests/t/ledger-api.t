#
# WRITTEN BLIND TO ANY IMPLEMENTATION. plugins/butler/scripts/bp-ledger.pl does not exist at the
# time this file was authored. Every AC assertion below must therefore fail on MISSING BEHAVIOUR,
# never on a bug in this file. Assertions labelled FIXTURE-SANITY: / HARNESS: are deliberate
# self-checks and are expected to pass with the script absent -- they are the evidence that the red
# is attributable to the missing implementation and not to broken scaffolding.
#
# WHY EVERY exit-2 EXPECTATION ALSO ASSERTS THE STDERR SHAPE: with bp-ledger.pl absent,
# `perl <missing>` itself exits 2 with a MULTI-line "Can't open perl script" on stderr. An
# exit-code-only assertion would therefore FALSELY PASS. Each rejection block asserts exit 2 AND
# exactly one stderr line AND the spec's framing prefix (§2.2), so the missing script cannot fake it.
#
# HARNESS RULES (from spec §2.9 and the coordinator's measured terrain; not re-derived):
#   * done_testing(), NEVER a hand-counted plan.
#   * %CLEAN_ENV strips every ambient BP_*: this suite is run BY coordinator sessions that export
#     BP_LEDGER/BP_DIR/BP_PROJECT_ROOT, and an inherited value turns the env-gate tests into false
#     passes.
#   * The hook is invoked as `bash "$HOOK"`, never executed directly: a missing exec bit must not
#     masquerade as a deny.
#   * NO LIVE LEDGER IS EVER WRITTEN. Corpus files are COPIED into a temp dir and every mutating op
#     runs on the copy. AC-41 digests every enumerated corpus file before and after the whole run.
#   * Corpus enumeration is perl `glob` on explicit paths -- NEVER `grep -r`/ripgrep on a directory:
#     .ccpraxis-local-data/ is gitignored, so a directory-scoped rg searches ZERO files and reports a
#     FALSE CLEAN. AC-43 proves this test's own method is the non-vacuous one.
#   * TWO globs, not one: `blueprints/*/packages/*.md` (active) PLUS
#     `blueprints/_archive/*/packages/*.md` (archived, one level deeper). A single `*` silently omits
#     every archive file -- the bug that hid two rejects for three corpus counts running.
#   * NO CORPUS SIZE IS EVER ASSERTED (AC-38). The corpus has grown 32 -> 49 -> 51 -> 115; pinning a
#     tally guarantees future spurious red. Non-vacuity and shape only.
#   * Durability assertions run in a temp dir created INSIDE $BP_DIR (v9fs), never /tmp (overlayfs).
#     A rename/flock assertion on overlayfs proves nothing about the filesystem ledgers live on.
#   * Output is captured via temp files, never by reopening STDOUT onto an in-memory scalar
#     (Git-for-Windows perl fails there with "Bad file descriptor"; project CLAUDE.md landmine).
#
# NO `use utf8` HERE, DELIBERATELY. The em dash in the append-attempt entry format is written as the
# raw bytes \xE2\x80\x94, because §2.4 is byte-oriented throughout and nothing is ever decoded.
#
# SYN-23: no assertion, fixture or comment in this file cites a line number in bp-orchestrator.pl.
# Everything about that file is located by grep pattern. AC-58 asserts it against this file itself.
#
# OUT-OF-FILE ACs (recorded here rather than asserted weakly):
#   * AC-54 -- `perl plugins/butler/tests/t/ledger-guard.t` exits 0. t/64 is the delegation's
#     byte-behaviour oracle and is NEVER read, edited or imported by this file (§2.9). Coordinator-
#     verified by running it.
#   * AC-55 -- "this file exits 0 with zero not ok" is self-referential. Coordinator-judged.
#   * AC-56 -- no new red in plugins/butler/tests/t/ attributable to b13; needs a before/after
#     baseline across the whole suite. Coordinator-verified.
#   * AC-57 -- `git diff --name-only` equals exactly the four write-set files. Coordinator-verified
#     (a test asserting it would fail on every unrelated in-flight edit in the working tree).
