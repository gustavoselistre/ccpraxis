# e03-autonomous-resolution oracle, part 1: BpResolve's PURE gates
# (verdict_shape_ok / verdict_in_bounds / confidence_gate / chronic_scoping_bump)
# and its deterministic apply-step (apply_verdict), plus the --digest CLI.
# Derived ONLY from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/butler-and-dashboard-overhaul/specs/
# e03-autonomous-resolution-spec.md (§2.1, §2.6) and e01's worked Decision-5
# fixtures (e01 spec §4/§4.1) -- never from any implementation.
#
# WRITTEN AGAINST THE CURRENT TREE, WHICH HAS NONE OF THIS YET:
#   - plugins/butler/scripts/bp-resolve.pl does not exist at all (confirmed,
#     scout report + this test-writer's own re-check immediately before
#     writing this file).
#   - No BpResolve package, no verdict_shape_ok/verdict_in_bounds/
#     confidence_gate/apply_verdict/chronic_scoping_bump subs anywhere.
#   - No runs/resolved-escalations/ directory concept exists anywhere in
#     bp-orchestrator.pl or bp-answer-decision.pl.
# Every group below is wrapped in run_group() so a missing bp-resolve.pl
# produces ONE clearly-labelled failing assertion per group (the require
# error, verbatim) rather than a single opaque script-wide die -- this keeps
# the criterion->assertion mapping legible even while the whole file is red
# for the single, correct reason: the deliverable does not exist yet.
#
# VACUITY GUARDS, stated up front so a reviewer can check each is honoured:
#   - Every REFUSE assertion is paired with a matching POSITIVE control using
#     the same category/action but the one changed field that should flip the
#     outcome (e.g. conformance+relaunch passes, conformance+accept refused --
#     never just "accept is refused" in isolation, which a
#     category-independent global ban on the STRING 'accept' could fake).
#   - AC2(a) is tested as an ORDER/FAILURE-COUPLING test, not a presence-only
#     test: the archive directory is pre-occupied by a plain FILE (forcing the
#     archive write to fail deterministically, cross-platform, without relying
#     on chmod semantics Windows does not honour), then we assert the QUEUE
#     FILE SURVIVES BYTE-IDENTICAL -- an implementation that unlinks first and
#     archives second would delete the queue file even though the archive
#     write failed, and this test would catch exactly that inversion.
#   - AC2(b)/provenance is tested with a POSITIVE marker equality check
#     (resolved_by eq the specific agent name), not merely "the key exists" --
#     a naive stamp of resolved_by => 1 or '' would fail this.
#   - Decision-5 fixtures (A3/A4) assert the record STAYS QUEUED (no archive,
#     file present) -- pairing the negative (no archive) with the positive
#     (queue file unchanged in its non-additive fields) so a resolver that
#     silently drops the record instead of tagging it cannot pass by accident.
#   - Fixture names are neutral ('alpha', 'blk9', 'e5') per the spec's own
#     named landmine -- never containing the substrings 'product' or
#     'resolved' where a test also matches on that substring in output.
