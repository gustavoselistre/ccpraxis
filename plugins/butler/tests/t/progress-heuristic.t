# t/63 — immutable oracle for b11-turns-backstop.
#
# Derived ONLY from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-butler-overhaul/specs/b11-turns-backstop-spec.md
# (section 3, C1..C8, plus the vacuity gate) and the two existing signals it replaces:
# BpOrch::progress_verdict and BpOrch::snapshot_progressed (bp-orchestrator.pl), whose old
# behaviour is asserted directly (required in-process) for contrast, never re-derived.
#
# WRITTEN BLIND TO ANY IMPLEMENTATION: plugins/butler/scripts/bp-progress.pl does not exist on
# disk yet. Every assertion against it is expected to fail on ABSENCE OF THE SCRIPT (perl's own
# "Can't open perl script ... No such file or directory" / a non-zero exit with no meaningful
# stdout from the `system()` call), never on a bug, missing module, or wrong path in THIS file.
#
# =====================================================================================
# INTERFACE CONTRACT ASSUMED BY THIS ORACLE -- bp-progress.pl does not exist, so nothing here is
# "confirmed against real source" (unlike t/82's bp-orchestrator.pl precedent); this section PINS
# the interface bp-progress.pl must satisfy, mirroring t/cache-state.t's own precedent of
# pinning a CLI contract ahead of an unwritten sibling script. The implementer's job is to match
# this, not the other way around.
#
#   CLI: perl bp-progress.pl verdict <bp> <pkg> [--now=EPOCH] [--repeat-flagged=0|1]
#        perl bp-progress.pl capped  <bp> <pkg> [--now=EPOCH]
#
#   - <bp>/<pkg> resolve exactly like bp-cache-state.pl's own convention (t/85 precedent),
#     itself mirroring bp-lib.sh's bp_dir/bp_ledger layout: CCPRAXIS_DATA_DIR/blueprints/<bp>/
#     packages/<pkg>.md, .../runs/<pkg>.jsonl, .../runs/registry.json. CCPRAXIS_DATA_DIR is the
#     existing env-var seam bp_data_dir() already reads. --now=EPOCH mirrors bp-cache-state.pl's
#     own injectable clock (needed so cadence/throttle fixtures don't depend on a moving wall
#     clock).
#   - `verdict` prints exactly one line "VERDICT\tREASON" to stdout (VERDICT one of
#     progressing|looping|stuck, REASON a non-empty one-line string), exit 0 always -- classifying
#     is this script's entire job, so even a maximally broken input must produce a verdict line,
#     never a language-level death (per C3's own "no ambiguous input may kill" framing, applied
#     to the process itself, not just the semantics).
#   - `--repeat-flagged=1` is how b10's already-fired mechanical repeat guard is CONSUMED as an
#     input (spec section 1: "consumes b10's repeat signal as an input rather than re-deriving
#     it"). When set, verdict returns "looping" immediately WITHOUT invoking the model seam (C6)
#     -- the hook already did the (free) classification; the (costly) semantic call must not
#     re-derive what is already known.
#   - The semantic classification itself is delegated to an INJECTED MODEL SEAM so this suite
#     runs offline/deterministically, per the task's own "no network, no real model calls"
#     requirement: the env var BP_PROGRESS_MODEL_CMD names a shell command. bp-progress.pl execs
#     it, writes the JSON-encoded transcript tail (an array of decoded jsonl objects) to its
#     stdin, and reads back exactly one line "VERDICT\tREASON" from its stdout. If the env var is
#     unset, the command fails to exec, exits non-zero, or its stdout does not parse as
#     "VERDICT\tREASON" with VERDICT in {progressing,looping,stuck} -- the model is being, in
#     effect, UNAVAILABLE, and C3 requires "progressing" with a stated reason.
#   - Bounded read: the transcript tail is read via bp-orchestrator.pl's existing seek-from-end
#     reader (_last_nonempty_line at bp-orchestrator.pl:853, or its already-shipped multi-line
#     sibling _tail_jsonl_objs at bp-orchestrator.pl:919, itself built on the same seek-from-end
#     discipline) -- reused via `require`, never reimplemented (C4).
#   - Throttle state persists at runs/<pkg>.progress-state.json: at minimum
#     {last_checked_at, last_verdict, last_reason}. A `verdict` call within
#     BP_PROGRESS_CADENCE_SEC (env, integer seconds, default assumed >0) of last_checked_at
#     returns the cached verdict/reason WITHOUT invoking the model seam again (C5 cadence half).
#   - Never-concurrent: a lock file at runs/<pkg>.progress.lock. A `verdict` call that finds this
#     lock already present must NOT invoke the model seam for that call (C5 concurrency half),
#     and must still emit a valid, non-crashing "progressing\tREASON" line (uncertainty rule,
#     C3's spirit applied to a locked-out tick).
#   - `capped` logs a DISTINCT condition to runs/orchestrator.log (JSON lines, one per line, the
#     house log shape already used by bp-orchestrator.pl's own `_log`) meaning "the heuristic
#     failed" -- pinned here as `type` containing the substring "heuristic" -- and never touches
#     the package's ledger file or registry.json (C7): reaching the cap is a signal about the
#     guard, not a package failure.
#
# SYN-23: nothing below cites a line number in bp-progress.pl (it doesn't exist). Line numbers
# cited against bp-orchestrator.pl (_last_nonempty_line:853, _tail_jsonl_objs:919,
# progress_verdict, snapshot_progressed) are grepped, not assumed.
#
# =====================================================================================
# MANDATORY VACUITY GATE (task's own standing rule, restated in the coordinator brief):
# C1 ("same command varied only cosmetically -> looping") and C2/C3 ("varied advancing work, and
# every ambiguous input -> progressing") are mutually constraining: a bp-progress.pl that always
# returns "looping" passes C1 and fails C2 and C3; one that always returns "progressing" passes
# C2 and C3 and fails C1. Both are driven off model-seam stubs that answer DIFFERENTLY per
# fixture (looping for C1's tail, progressing for C2's tail) so a bp-progress.pl that merely
# hardcodes a constant -- ignoring the seam entirely -- cannot satisfy both. An explicit
# cross-check after C3 asserts the C1 and C2 verdicts actually DIFFER, in the same file, so no
# constant-returning implementation of ANY kind (model-driven or hardcoded) can pass silently.
#
# C4/C5/C6 are negative-only ("no slurp", "not every tick", "not invoked") and each is preceded
# by a POSITIVE assertion that the operation in question actually happened first:
#   - C4: a POSITIVE well-formed-fixture read (a real epoch extracted) is asserted before the
#     10.3MB bounded-read / reader-reuse checks.
#   - C5: the model seam's invocation counter is asserted to have incremented at least once
#     (real activity happened) before the "cadence" and "lock" cases assert it does NOT
#     increment again.
#   - C6: the SAME fixture WITHOUT --repeat-flagged is asserted to invoke the model seam (proving
#     a semantic call WOULD otherwise occur) immediately before the --repeat-flagged=1 case
#     asserts the counter does NOT move.
# No SKIP appears anywhere in this file. Absence is always a FAILURE, never a skip.
