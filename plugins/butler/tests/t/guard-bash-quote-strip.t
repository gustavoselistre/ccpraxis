# 167 -- oracle for t09-guard-hooks-stripping's guard-bash.sh
# changes (spec .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/tui-operator-feedback/specs/
# t09-guard-hooks-stripping-spec.md SS2.2/SS2.3/SS3/SS4).
#
# THIS IS GUARD-BASH.SH'S FIRST BEHAVIOR TEST, EVER (spec AC19 / scout open question 5).
# The scout confirmed only registration/route tests existed before this file
# (hooks-json-route-registration.t, mark-wakeup-agent-dispatch.t) -- neither
# exercises guard-bash.sh's own matcher logic. This file IS the "baseline before edit"
# the ledger's done criterion 5 demands for this hook: it is a FRESHLY-AUTHORED
# baseline, not an inherited one, exactly as AC19 rules. Run once against the pre-fix
# guard-bash.sh (AC5/AC7 expected RED -- no stripping exists yet, mirroring 106's own
# documented AC-16 pattern) and once green post-fix.
#
# WRITTEN BLIND TO THE IMPLEMENTATION.
#
# jq AVAILABILITY. guard-bash.sh hard-requires jq (bp_hook_require_jq, fail-closed) --
# unlike guard-git-mutations.sh's jq-or-perl bp_json_get. jq does not exist on this
# Windows host, so every subprocess assertion below is gated behind a runtime check and
# SKIPped on a jq-less host, matching guard-judge-checks.t's own documented
# convention -- a SKIP here reads as "not exercised on this host", never as a false
# green or a harness bug.
#
# TECHNIQUE NOTE (guard evasion). Every fixture reaches guard-bash.sh only as JSON
# payload TEXT in a temp file (Write tool / this test's own file writes), never as
# literal text in a Bash tool_input.command this session issues. The hook is invoked as
# a subprocess via `bash "$GPATH" < "$PFILE"`.

#
# This used to build a shadow bin/ by symlinking every executable on PATH (plus
# /usr/bin, /bin, /usr/local/bin) except $name. Measured on this host that is
# 6401 symlinks, and in t/168 -- which had the identical helper -- it made that
# file the slowest in the repository by a wide margin: 237s, of which ~20s was
# creating them and ~167s was File::Temp's CLEANUP deleting them again at
# process exit. The teardown dominated because File::Path::rmtree is pure Perl
# walking one entry at a time through the MSYS layer; native `rm -rf` does the
# same directory in 1.4s. After this change t/168 runs in 0.6s.
#
# The intent is "a PATH on which $name cannot be found". Removing the
# directories that contain it expresses exactly that, costs one stat per PATH
# entry instead of thousands of symlinks, and creates nothing to clean up.
#
# It is also MORE faithful than the mirror was: the mirror silently dropped
# anything that was not a regular executable file, so the code under test ran
# under a PATH subtly unlike the real one. This keeps the real PATH minus $name.
