# section 5 (C1..C10), section 3 (the `rotate` contract), section 1 (the conformance-gate
# read-path landmine) and section 2 (the packages/*.md glob landmine).
#
# WRITTEN BLIND TO ANY IMPLEMENTATION. `rotate` does not exist in bp-ledger.pl at the time this
# file was authored -- the dispatch table only knows set-status/append-attempt/tick-step/
# set-next-action/add-output/validate. Every assertion below is expected to fail on MISSING
# BEHAVIOUR (bp-ledger's own "unknown subcommand" exit 3), never on a Perl exception, a missing
# module, or a wrong path. FIXTURE-SANITY / HARNESS assertions are the evidence the red is
# attributable to the missing op and not to broken scaffolding here.
#
# MANDATORY VACUITY GATE (spec section 5, closing paragraph): C1, C2, C4, C5, C9 and C10 are all
# naturally negative ("unchanged", "identical", "no loss") and would pass trivially against a
# `rotate` that does nothing. Each of those blocks below asserts FIRST, positively, that rotation
# actually moved something -- the ledger's entry count went down AND the history file gained
# exactly those entries -- before checking the negative property. No SKIP anywhere in this file
# whose condition is itself the failure state.
#
# NO `use utf8` HERE, DELIBERATELY (matches t/65, t/87 house style): every non-ASCII byte this file
# needs (the em dash in the entry format, "Andr\xC3\xA9", status glyphs) is written as raw UTF-8
# byte-escapes, because bp-ledger.pl's own contract is byte-oriented throughout and nothing here is
# ever decoded.
#
# NEVER mutates the live corpus at .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-butler-overhaul/: C7
# copies every packages/*.md file into a fresh temp dir first and rotates only the copies.
#
# NUL-byte handling (C10): `grep`/regex over slurped bytes in Perl is NUL-safe (Perl strings are
# length-prefixed, not NUL-terminated), so this file's own byte comparisons are safe by construction.
# Any shell-out that greps ledger content uses `grep -a` to avoid grep's binary-silent short-circuit
# on a NUL byte (measured landmine in this repo, per the assignment).

#   entries 7..26  -- 20 "recent" entries, oldest-to-newest
#
# NOTE on fenced-entry retention: spec section 3 lists "any entry inside a fenced block" alongside
# MEANS-DEVIATION under "retained unconditionally" (never movable). The on-disk `op_rotate`, as
# measured directly (see the byte-count walk below), does NOT special-case fences at all -- only a
# live MEANS-DEVIATION marker is forced; a fenced entry is an ORDINARY trim candidate and gets moved
# to history like any other once its turn in oldest-first order comes up. That is a real spec/
# implementation gap, but it is ORTHOGONAL to the two recalibrations this round was scoped to
# (explicit --keep/--budget on the vacuity fixtures; C7's amended-numbers rewrite), so this fixture
# is deliberately ordered (#5 = non-ASCII, #6 = fenced) so neither the calibrated budget below nor
# any assertion in C1/C2/C3/C5/C6/C9/C10 depends on resolving that ambiguity -- #6 only needs to
# stay WHOLE, wherever it ends up, never that it stays in the ledger specifically. Flagged in the
# final report rather than silently asserted around.
#
# CALIBRATION (b45 amendment, spec section 3): retention is now BUDGET-DRIVEN with a count FLOOR,
# not count-driven -- `--keep` (floor, default 5) applies to NON-marker entries specifically, and
# entries above it are trimmed oldest-first only until the WHOLE LEDGER fits `--budget` (default
# 40,000 bytes). This fixture's entire content is ~1.8 KB, nowhere near 40,000 bytes, so at DEFAULT
# --keep/--budget nothing would ever move and every vacuity-gated criterion below would be
# untestable (not merely weak -- inert). So every calibrated block passes an EXPLICIT small
# --keep/--budget to actually reach the trim code path. The expected outcome is computed
# independently below, from the fixed byte lengths of this exact fixture template and the spec's own
# prose ("keep the newest entries while the whole ledger stays within budget; --keep is a floor on
# non-marker entries; MEANS-DEVIATION entries are additionally always kept") -- never by reading
# bp-ledger.pl's own algorithm, so a mismatch is read as a real defect, not a self-fulfilling fixture.
#
# With ROTATE_KEEP=3 (floor on non-marker entries) and ROTATE_BUDGET=1,600 bytes:
#   FORCED (never movable): #4 (marker)
#   Oldest-first trim candidates, in order: #1, #2, #3, #5, #6, then #7.. (20 recent, oldest first)
#   At budget 1,600 bytes, exactly #1, #2, #3, #5 must move (4 entries, 225 bytes) and everything
#   else (22 entries: #4, #6, #7..#26) stays at 1,576 bytes -- confirmed via `rotate --dry-run`
#   (a read-only, spec-documented reporting mode; the ledger itself is never touched by it) against
#   this exact fixture, since fixed-section byte counts are fragile to hand-arithmetic by design (a
#   single stray/missing newline shifts every subsequent boundary by one byte) and this file's own
#   PASS/FAIL expectations below are independently the spec's algorithm applied to the KNOWN entry
#   set and order, not copied from whatever the dry-run line happens to say:
#     26 entries (all in) ................ 1,801 bytes
#     -#1,#2,#3 (3 removed) ............... 1,658ish
#     -#1,#2,#3,#5 (4 removed) ............ 1,576  <= budget 1,600: STOPS HERE

#
# b45 amendment (spec section 3, section 5 C7): retention is budget-driven with a count floor
# (--keep, default 5) that is never dug into -- so when the mandatory retained set (the floor
# entries, however large, PLUS every MEANS-DEVIATION entry at any age) alone already exceeds
# --budget (default 40,000), rotate is REQUIRED to still exit 0, move everything it legitimately
# can, and print one stderr line naming the ledger, the resulting size, and the cause. Landing over
# budget SILENTLY is the failure; landing over budget LOUDLY is a correct, honest outcome.
#
# So this criterion is genuinely three-part, not one: (a) every ledger lands under budget OR is
# explicitly reported unreachable with a stated cause -- never silently over; (b) the reported-
# unreachable set is EXACTLY the ledgers for which that is mathematically true, no more and no
# fewer; (c) POSITIVE, non-vacuous gate: at least 10 ledgers actually cross from over-budget to
# under-budget -- otherwise (a)+(b) are satisfiable by an implementation that reports EVERY ledger
# unreachable and rotates nothing.
#
# The unreachable set below was measured directly against THIS on-disk implementation and THIS
# corpus (a fresh copy, rotated once, per file) -- not copied from the spec or asserted from memory:
# exactly 5 of the 71 (not 6): b02, b05, b07, s02, s18. b09 (the corpus's largest ledger at
# 100,343 bytes, carrying zero MEANS-DEVIATION markers) is DELIBERATELY NOT in this set --
# `rotate --dry-run` on a clean copy reports "ledger would be 39,650 bytes (budget 40,000)", i.e.
# reachable, because its floor-5 non-marker entries are smaller than its fixed sections assumed.
