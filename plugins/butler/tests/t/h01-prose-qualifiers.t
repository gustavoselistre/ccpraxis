# 123 — oracle for done criterion 5 (h01 spec §2.6/§2.7,
# AC5): the prose is fixed too, as the EXPLANATION, not the mechanism.
#
# THE CONTRADICTION THIS PINS. coordinator-protocol/SKILL.md tells agents, in
# the instruction sentence itself ("The pattern: launch in the background, end
# the turn, resume on the notification..."), to background-and-end-turn — with
# NO qualifier in that sentence, even though a scoping blockquote already sits
# six lines above it ("This section is for MULTI-TURN sessions only"). A
# reader who quotes or excerpts the instruction sentence out of context (as a
# harvest judge effectively did) recovers the unqualified, wrong instruction.
# §2.6's contract is explicit: the qualifier must be IN the instruction
# sentence, not only in the blockquote above it — so this test extracts ONLY
# that sentence/paragraph and asserts against it, never the whole file (a
# whole-file scan would pass today already, vacuously, because the blockquote
# already exists).
#
# Eight agent files (§2.7) get the same qualification added to their own
# `## Hard limits` section — confirmed absent in ALL eight today (grepped
# fresh: no file mentions background/foreground/run_in_background anywhere).
#
# Runs standalone: perl this file
