#
# bp-ledger.pl's V4b/V4c checks now REFUSE to write a write_set: field carrying
# prose or a Windows drive letter, so the corruption cannot be created through
# the sanctioned path any more. That does nothing for a session already running
# with a corrupt BP_WRITE_SET: guard-writes.sh reads only the env var, nothing
# re-derives it mid-session, and the refusal used to print the RAW colon-joined
# string. A coordinator therefore saw "outside this package's write set" for a
# path plainly listed in its own ledger, diagnosed a SCOPE dispute, and
# escalated for a re-scope it did not need -- the scope was already correct and
# only its serialization was broken. The report's closing line is that a
# self-diagnosing message would have turned a half-session of misdiagnosis into
# a five-second read.
#
# This file asserts the MESSAGE, and asserts that the allow/deny decision is
# unchanged by it. A guard that explains itself better but decides differently
# would be a regression in the direction that matters: guard-writes.sh exists
# because a worker writing outside its scope is how an oracle gets edited.
#
# guard-writes.sh is GATED (bp_hook_gate, the old shared bash guard library) -- it no-ops entirely
# unless BP_LEDGER, BP_DIR and BP_PROJECT_ROOT are ALL set, so every invocation
# below sets all three. A test that forgot one would pass vacuously.
