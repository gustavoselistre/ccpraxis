#
# THE LIVE DEFECT THIS PINS, OBSERVED THIS SESSION, NOT HYPOTHESISED. A real
# /butler:drive-solo driver session's own Bash invocation quoted its (non-ASCII,
# "Andr\x{e9}") script path defensively:
#
#   perl "C:/Users/Andr\x{e9}/.claude/ccpraxis/plugins/butler/scripts/bp-drive-next.pl" next --scope backup-driver
#
# bp_wakeup_arm_check (mark-wakeup.sh) runs bp_strip_shell_noise (bp-lib.sh)
# on the raw command before matching. That helper blanks EVERY character
# inside a quoted span, quoted program path or not, so the literal text
# "bp-drive-next.pl" is gone from the stripped text before the arming regex
# ever runs. The registry marker under .drive-solo-active/<session_id> was
# never written; both consumers of it were silently inert:
#   1. gate-drive-loop.sh (the Stop gate) never fired for this session at all.
#   2. the statusline's "driving" badge (scripts/statusline.pl) never showed.
# The operator noticed the missing badge; the disarmed gate was the more
# serious half, discovered only by inspecting mark-wakeup.sh's own logic.
#
# THE FIX: mark-wakeup.sh's own bp_unquote_script_paths (local to this file,
# not a change to bp_strip_shell_noise itself — that helper is shared with
# guard-validation-interlock.sh for an unrelated job) un-quotes a quoted span
# BEFORE the strip pipeline runs, but ONLY when the span's entire content is
# a bare path ending ".pl" with no whitespace or shell metacharacter inside.
# Everything else — including a quoted span that merely CONTAINS the
# substring amid other words — is left exactly as bp_strip_shell_noise would
# have found it.
#
# THIS FILE PROVES THREE THINGS TOGETHER, not just "it now arms":
#   A/B. the two real quoted-path shapes (double- and single-quoted) now arm
#        the DRIVER registry, where before this fix (git HEAD at the time
#        this test was authored) neither did — verified by hand against a
#        copy of the pre-fix hook, see the report for the exact commands run.
#   C.   the REPORTER's own arm site (bp-watch.pl --arm --blueprint, quoted
#        the same way) shares the fix, not just the driver's regex.
#   D/E. the two counter-fixtures that prove the detector still VETOES an
#        inert mention -- the whole reason bp_strip_shell_noise exists. If a
#        broader fix had simply stopped blanking quotes altogether, these
#        would fail.
#   F.   the plain unquoted invocation still arms -- no regression.
#
# Runs standalone: perl this file

# ASCII stand-in for the real path component ("André"). The defect is about

# free of this host's own backtick/heredoc byte-encoding behaviour, which is
