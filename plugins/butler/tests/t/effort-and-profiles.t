# t/75 — immutable oracle for b23-effort-quality-and-turn-sizing.
#
# Derived ONLY from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-butler-overhaul/specs/b23-effort-quality-and-turn-sizing-spec.md
# (C1..C8, §3, plus the vacuity gate). Four things are being built by this package, NONE of them
# exist on disk yet at the time this oracle was written:
#   1. effort plumbing (ledger `effort:` -> DAG `effort` column -> bp-orchestrator -> bp-launch.sh
#      -> `claude --effort <level>`) -- grepped: bp-launch.sh's two `claude` invocation sites pass
#      only --model/--max-turns/--dangerously-skip-permissions, never --effort.
#   2. BP_MAX_PARALLEL 2 -> 3 at bp-orchestrator.pl's two sites (_tunables_base's `// 2` and the
#      per-tick `local $ENV{BP_MAX_PARALLEL} = $t->{max_par} // 2`).
#   3. raised max_turns authoring defaults, documented in authoring-protocol/SKILL.md (today:
#      "backstop (default 80)").
#   4. the always-ask, no-default quality-profile question at authoring time (operator ruling R-03).
#      SUPERSEDED 2026-09-19 by operator ruling R-04: the profile now defaults to `normal` silently
#      and is never asked; `higher` is opt-in, only on an explicit request. C7 below was rewritten to
#      assert the NEW ruling, not the old one -- see its own header comment for what changed.
#
# WRITTEN BLIND TO THE FIX. Every assertion below is expected to fail on ABSENCE OF THE FEATURE
# (a missing flag, a stale default, missing doc prose), never on a Perl exception, a missing module,
# a wrong require path, or a bash syntax error — bp-launch.sh and bp-orchestrator.pl are both
# well-formed, callable scripts today; only the FOUR behaviours above are missing.
#
# TECHNIQUE: no existing butler test invokes bp-launch.sh directly (t/06/t/08/t/80/t/82 all inject
# a `launch` closure that stands in for it). Per the driver's explicit instruction, THIS file drives
# the real bp-launch.sh with a stub `claude` shadowing PATH (house style borrowed from
# t/worker-model-preference.t's FAKE_BACKEND: a fake binary on PATH, invoked via `bash -c` +
# `timeout`, argv captured to a delimited log file) so C1..C4 are asserted on the ACTUAL CONSTRUCTED
# COMMAND LINE bp-launch.sh hands to `claude`, per the spec's own C1 instruction ("assert on the
# built command, not a helper's return value"). This is NOT the launcher.pl/container-build class of
# test the project CLAUDE.md forbids spawning unguarded — bp-launch.sh here execs only a tiny fake
# shell script that sleeps ~2s and exits; every invocation is wrapped in `timeout` as a safety net.
# We are inside the sandbox (IS_SANDBOX=1 already set), so bp_require_sandbox never trips.
#
# C5/C6 are asserted in-process against bp-orchestrator.pl (required as a module, exactly like
# t/80/t/82: BpOrch::parse_dag called directly; BpOrch::run({...}) driven with injected
# now/sleep/http_get/http_post/spawn_judge seams and `once=>1` — never bp-orchestrator.pl's own CLI
# entry point, never launcher.pl, never a container).
#
# C7/C8 are asserted as textual invariants against the two SKILL.md files named in the write set
# (plugins/blueprint/skills/authoring-protocol/, plugins/blueprint/skills/create/) — the only
# testable surface for an authoring-time interactive protocol.
#
# =====================================================================================
# MANDATORY VACUITY GATE (spec's own standing rule, verified explicitly here):
#
#   * C3 ("absent effort -> no flag, byte-identical to today's command line") is negative-only and
#     passes trivially against an implementation that NEVER passes --effort at all (i.e. against
#     today's actual code). It is therefore asserted with the SAME comparison function used for
#     C1/C2: `strip_effort_pair()` + `normalize_argv()` compute the exact expected baseline argv
#     (cold and warm, byte-for-byte, every flag in order) and require C3's actual argv to equal it
#     EXACTLY, while C1/C2 require the actual argv to equal it exactly ONLY AFTER a single adjacent
#     ('--effort', <level>) pair is stripped out — and separately require that pair to have been
#     FOUND (`ok($found, ...)`) with the RIGHT VALUE. A never-pass-effort implementation satisfies
#     the C3 shape (nothing to strip, already equal) but FAILS C1/C2's "found" assertion outright.
#     This is asserted for BOTH call sites separately (C2's own per-site requirement) — the
#     cold-present/warm-present checks sit directly next to the cold-absent/warm-absent checks in
#     the SAME block, sharing the same ledger fixtures and comparison function.
#   * C4 asserts, in this order: (a) nothing was appended to the fake claude's call log (no argv
#     recorded at all — the strongest form of "nothing was launched"), (b) no runs/<pkg>.pid file
#     was written, (c) the package has no entry in runs/registry.json, and only THEN (d) that
#     bp-launch.sh exited non-zero, and (e) stderr names the cause. Asserting (a)-(c) before (d)
#     is deliberate: a script that prints an error to stderr and STILL execs claude would pass a
#     naive "check the exit code" gate; it is refused here on the stronger "nothing launched"
#     ground the spec names explicitly.
#   * C7's "no default" is likewise negative: the block below first asserts POSITIVELY that the
#     normal-vs-higher question is reachable (present, and framed as mandatory) in BOTH skill docs,
#     UNCONDITIONALLY runs the negative check right after (never behind a skip/conditional — a doc
#     that never mentions the question at all would otherwise pass the negative vacuously; both
#     halves must be read together, and the positive half is what would catch that).
