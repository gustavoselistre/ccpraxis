# 122 — oracle for the REVISED registration
# decision (g02 spec §2.1-§2.3, INVERTING h01's original §2.5 decision):
# gate-headless-background.sh and guard-judge-checks.sh register ONLY in
# plugins/butler/hooks/hooks.json (${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}-relative), never in
# .claude/settings.json.
#
# THIS FILE WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN FOR THE OPPOSITE DESIGN, AND THAT DESIGN
# SHIPPED A DEFECT. h01's architect traced bp-launch.sh:112 and bp-judge.sh:169
# and found both `cd "$PROJECT_ROOT"` immediately before `claude -p ...` with
# no `--settings` override, and concluded .claude/settings.json (tracked,
# live in THIS clone immediately) "already reaches coordinator AND judge
# sessions". That conclusion is true ONLY when the project being driven is
# ccpraxis itself: $PROJECT_ROOT for a coordinator driving DAME or GSA is
# THAT project's root, whose tree has no plugins/butler/hooks/ at all and
# whose own .claude/settings.json contains no such entry either (g02 scout,
# verified against both). Coordinators and judges overwhelmingly run in
# OTHER projects, so the original design was inert exactly where the
# incident it cites (2026-08-11 GSA fleet collapse) happened. g02 exists to
# fix that scope error. THE FIX IS A ROUTE CHANGE, NOT A BEHAVIOR CHANGE:
# ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} resolves machine-wide via the live install regardless
# of which project is being driven (g02 scout item 1, confirmed against
# DAME's own settings.local.json already carrying butler@ccpraxis-local),
# and 119/121 continue to pin the scripts' own behavior once invoked,
# unmodified by this package. This file pins the (now-corrected) registration
# route; it does not re-litigate anything 119/121 already own.
#
# THE HONEST COST, so a future reader does not assume this was free (g02
# spec §1, done criterion 3): the settings.json route's liveness advantage —
# no promotion needed, read straight off this clone's disk — is GIVEN UP for
# these two hooks, in every case, including a coordinator driven from THIS
# very clone. hooks.json is plugin code, resolved via the marketplace
# mechanism to the PROMOTED live install (~/.claude/ccpraxis), never to this
# clone, for any session. A mid-run edit to either script or to hooks.json's
# registration of them is invisible until `git -C ~/.claude/ccpraxis pull
# <clone> main`. That is not independently re-provable by this file (it
# would require launching and promoting a real session — out of reach for
# this suite, g02 spec §6) — it is recorded here in prose so the trade is
# visible, not silently assumed away.
#
# NEVER MUTATES the real .claude/settings.json or hooks.json — read-only
# assertions against the tracked files, exactly like
# plugins/sandbox/tests/t/settings-scope-split.t's C5 section, which
# already establishes this read-only pattern for the same settings.json file.
#
# Runs standalone: perl this file
