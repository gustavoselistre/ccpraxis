# t/114 — accepting a harvest failure must be DURABLE.
#
# THE BUG. `bp-answer-decision.pl --action accept` set the ledger to `done` and
# stopped there. But the orchestrator fires a harvest audit on
# (status done, harvest EMPTY, none in flight) — BpJudge::want_harvest_audit —
# so a package whose harvest never produced a verdict was re-armed on the very
# next tick. Accepting settled nothing.
#
# Reported from a live GSA fleet run: EIGHT consecutive re-fires of the same
# harvest-failure decision, each re-accepted by hand. It compounded the
# one-shot judge deadlock fixed in 0841130 — that judge could never write a
# verdict, so nothing would ever fill the field and the loop had no exit.
#
# 'pass' specifically is required, not a more honest-looking 'accepted': gate
# mode admits dependents only on `harvest eq 'pass'` (bp-judge.pl:52), so any
# other value strands them. Provenance is kept in a separate field instead.
