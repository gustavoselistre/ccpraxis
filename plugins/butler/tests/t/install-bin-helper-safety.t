# Fix-batch B2/B3 (redteam-step6.md HIGH-3, MEDIUM-4) coverage for
# scripts/_install-bin-helper.pl (repo root -- out of package 04's write
# set, fixed in place per .ccpraxis-local-data/guidance/
# fix-ccpraxis-defects-in-place.md).
#
# B2 (HIGH-3): a failed powershell.exe read of the User PATH used to be
# silently laundered into "PATH is empty", after which a subsequent write
# could overwrite the ENTIRE User-scope PATH registry value with just the
# new bin dir -- with no snapshot to recover from. Fixed: ps_get_env now
# checks the child's exit status and dies rather than returning empty; and
# run_windows snapshots the current PATH to ~/.claude/.path-snapshots/
# before its first registry write.
#
# B3 (MEDIUM-4): glob() word-splits its pattern on whitespace, so any
# install path containing a space silently returned the wrong/empty
# @launchers list, disabling chmod + extensionless-alias creation with no
# error. Fixed: File::Glob::bsd_glob.
#
# ISOLATION. Never touches this host's real Windows PATH/registry. B2's
# tests intercept powershell.exe via the CCPRAXIS_TEST_POWERSHELL_GET_ARGV
# / CCPRAXIS_TEST_POWERSHELL_SET_ARGV testability seams (added by this same
# fix, inert unless set) rather than a real fake .exe -- a batch/script file
# named *.exe is not a valid Win32 application and would make `open` fail
# for the wrong reason. B3's test forces $^O to force the file-based
# run_unix branch, same technique as bp-commands-on-path.t's AC4/AC8 (never
# reaches run_windows/the registry). $HOME is always overridden to an
# isolated tempdir, so a real snapshot write (B2) never touches the real
# ~/.claude/.path-snapshots/.
