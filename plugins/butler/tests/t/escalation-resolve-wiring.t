# 173 — the escalation-resolve judge path is actually wired.
#
# WHAT IS BEING PROTECTED
#
# bp-orchestrator.pl carries this comment above its escalation-resolve dispatch:
#
#     # 'escalation-resolve' is a new VALUE here, not new code, per e03 spec
#
# It was wrong three times over, and nothing caught it for the entire life of the
# feature. bp-judge.sh is NOT value-agnostic: it gates on an allow-list and
# derives two file paths from $KIND.
#
#   1. `case "$KIND" in harvest|resolve|conformance)` rejected the kind outright.
#   2. AGENT_FILE=agents/bp-$KIND-judge.md  ->  bp-escalation-resolve-judge.md,
#      which has never existed (the real agent is bp-escalation-resolver.md --
#      different stem, no `-judge` suffix).
#   3. TEMPLATE=templates/judge-$KIND.md   ->  judge-escalation-resolve.md,
#      which did not exist either.
#
# So the autonomous-resolution path had never once executed. Every escalation
# reached the operator, which is precisely the failure the feature exists to
# prevent -- and the orchestrator, having no spawn cap on this kind, retried
# roughly every ten seconds forever. Almanac 20260824-170753-01b8, filed from a
# live run: 19+ spawn failures in the minute the operator watched it.
#
# WHY THIS FILE IS STRUCTURAL RATHER THAN BEHAVIOURAL
#
# bp-judge.sh calls bp_require_sandbox and `require_cmd jq flock claude setsid
# realpath` in its first ten lines. On the Git-for-Windows host none of that
# holds (no jq, not a sandbox), so it exits long before the allow-list -- and
# running it anywhere it DOESN'T exit early would launch a real `claude`
# process, which a test must never do.
#
# The assertions below therefore re-derive the paths using the script's OWN
# rules, read out of the script, and check they resolve. That is what makes this
# a rule rather than three instances: add a fifth judge kind tomorrow without its
# agent file or template, and this turns red for the new kind automatically.
#
# Runs standalone: perl this file
