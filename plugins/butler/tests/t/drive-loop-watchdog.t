# The drive-solo run's dead-man's switch.
#
# WHY A SECOND MECHANISM EXISTS
#
# t/94 covers gate-drive-loop.sh, which catches a driver turn that ends with
# NOTHING SCHEDULED. That is one of two failure modes and the easier one.
#
# The other is WEDGED rather than STOPPED: the driver dispatches a worker, the
# turn legitimately ends (a wake-up WAS scheduled), and the notification never
# arrives — the worker hung, died silently, or is itself waiting on something
# that can never happen. No Stop event fires, so no Stop hook can help. The
# session sits idle indefinitely, looking exactly like a session that is
# working. DAME field report batch-1 #11 is this in the wild: an orphaned
# watcher still looping after seventeen hours, counted as live the whole time.
#
# bp-watchdog.pl is the suspenders to that belt. Armed with run_in_background,
# its own expiry is a wake-up the driver controls, so even if every other
# wake-up in the run is lost the session revives on this one. It converts
# silent death into at most one window of silence.
#
# THE PROPERTY THIS FILE PROTECTS MOST
#
# A watchdog that spins, or waits on a condition that can never be true, is
# just another wedged watcher — the very defect it exists to catch. So the
# structural assertions in section D matter as much as the verdict logic:
# ONE sleep, no loop, no polling, always exit 0, never kills anything.
#
# Runs standalone: perl this file
