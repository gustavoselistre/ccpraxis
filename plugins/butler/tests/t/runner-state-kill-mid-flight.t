#!/usr/bin/env perl
# Pins AC-6 and AC-7 of the --state=failed spec (DC5 in the package ledger):
# a sweep killed mid-flight (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL if it does not yield) must
# leave the state file exactly as it was before the invocation started -- no
# premature write, so an in-flight file's prior "failed" status is never
# silently cleared -- and the final filename, read back, must contain only
# complete, newline-terminated lines, never a truncated partial write.
#
# A companion, un-killed control run against the SAME two-file fixture and an
# EMPTY state dir establishes the positive baseline this negative property is
# measured against: without a control run showing a completed sweep DOES
# write, "the state file is unchanged after a kill" would hold vacuously for
# any script that never implements writing at all. Both blocks are expected
# to fail against scripts/run-tests.pl as it stands today -- the control
# block because nothing is ever written yet, the kill block only in the
# sense that its positive companion is what gives it meaning (see the report
# for the full discussion of why the kill assertion alone cannot pin a
# feature's total absence).
#
# Kill choreography mirrors plugins/butler/scripts/bp-worker.pl:40-58
# (TERM, brief grace, KILL, blocking waitpid). Every invocation of
# scripts/run-tests.pl targets this file's own File::Temp fixture, never the
# real plugins/*/tests/t/ tree, and every wait loop here is itself bounded.
