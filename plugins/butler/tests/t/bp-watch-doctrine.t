# 135 — IMMUTABLE ORACLE for w01-bp-watch's doctrine
# surface: criterion 10 (registers as a legitimate wake-up), criterion 10a
# (self-contained arm, no forgettable re-arm), the --keepawake lease refresh,
# and the bp-watchdog.pl supersession (criterion 8/§2.3/§3.6) plus the
# docs-consistency check (criterion 11, checks:docs-consistency).
#
# Spec: specs/w01-bp-watch-spec.md §2.2 (--keepawake), §2.3 (bp-watchdog.pl
# supersession), §2.4/§2.5 (SKILL.md updates), §3 behaviors 12-14, §4
# AC10/AC10a/AC11.
#
# AC10a IS PARTIAL BY DESIGN (spec §3.5, package ledger 2026-08-13T20:22:11Z
# entry). This file asserts ONLY what w01 actually guarantees — a single arm
# whose --max-seconds covers the whole dispatch, with no routine tick to
# forget (already pinned as behavior 11 in t/134's B5/F5/D3 timing
# assertions) — and the doctrine text naming the residual. It does NOT assert
# that an agent always re-arms after a genuine BOUND exit; that is explicitly
# NOT closed by this package (handed to w02) and asserting it here would be
# inventing behavior the spec does not claim.
