# 119 — oracle for gate-headless-background.sh
# (h01-headless-background-gate spec §2.1, done criteria 1/2/3/7).
#
# THE INCIDENT THIS PINS. A harvest judge backgrounded a Bash call and ended
# its turn reasoning "I'll just stop and wait for that notification" — three
# times in the 2026-08-11 GSA fleet run. A headless `claude -p` has no next
# turn: the process exits when the turn ends, the notification has nowhere to
# arrive, and no verdict is ever written (sources/2026-08-11-gsa-fleet-collapse.md
# Bug 1). Decisions 2/3 (blueprint.md) are binding: enforce with a HOOK, and
# make it headless-AWARE — a blanket deny would break the mirror-image defect
# (Bug 7) where an INTERACTIVE driver's legitimate backgrounded dispatch gets
# blocked by gate-drive-loop.sh for want of a recorded wake-up.
#
# THE CONTRACT UNDER TEST (spec §2.1): the verdict is a pure function of
# BP_LEDGER's PRESENCE in the process environment. BP_ROLE customises the
# DENIAL MESSAGE ONLY — never the decision. A test that lets BP_ROLE change
# the decision must fail; several assertions below exist specifically to
# catch that regression in either direction (role that should still deny;
# role that must NOT itself trigger a deny with no BP_LEDGER).
#
# Runs standalone: perl this file
# No container, no network; every fixture lives under File::Temp.
