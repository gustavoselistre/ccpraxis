# t/109 -- a03 oracle.
# Derived ONLY from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/butler-and-dashboard-overhaul/specs/a03-spec.md
# section 3 (the 8 enumerated cases), section 2 (what to build) and section 1 (ground truth).
#
# WRITTEN BLIND TO THE IMPLEMENTATION of the fix. The spec deliberately leaves the suppression
# mechanism open ("any mechanism that survives across processes is acceptable" -- section 2.1), so
# nothing here asserts a marker file, an env var, or any other internal representation. Every
# assertion is against OBSERVABLE behaviour only: exit codes, stderr shape, and file contents.
#
# READ SECTION 1 BEFORE TRUSTING THE PACKAGE DESCRIPTION: append-attempt does NOT refuse over
# budget, and never has (emit_err only prints; it never exits). This file never asserts a refusal --
# doing so would be asserting a behaviour change the spec explicitly rules out (section 4).
#
# THREE THINGS EXPECTED TO FAIL AGAINST HEAD, for the reasons the spec names:
#   - CASE2 / CASE4: the budget/irreducible notices currently reuse the exact
#     `bp-ledger: <op>: <path>: <message>` shape the four error helpers (arg_error/io_error/
#     reject_error/notfound_error) emit, and carry no stable machine-readable token (spec 2.1/2.2).
#   - CASE5/CASE6 (suppression): today there is no cross-process suppression at all -- every
#     `bp-ledger.pl` invocation is a fresh process and re-emits the notice on every over-budget
#     append (spec 2.1, second bullet).
#   - CASE7: `ensure_dir_exists` (bp-ledger.pl:698-710) treats a Windows drive-absolute path
#     (`C:/...`) as relative (`$dir =~ m{^/}` never matches), rebuilding the whole target tree under
#     the process's CWD instead of at the drive-absolute location, then failing later when the real
#     target still doesn't exist (spec 1c). Reproduced for real -- this is a regression test for an
#     artifact that was actually produced, not a hypothetical.
#   - CASE8: the documented one-stderr-line invariant (bp-ledger.pl:20) is currently violated on a
#     rotate that is BOTH irreducible AND still moves some (non-floor) entries and then hits an I/O
#     failure: the irreducible notice plus the io_error are two lines (spec 1d).
# CASE1 (plain in-budget append) and the "diagnosis wording preserved" / "rotate exits 0"
# sub-assertions of CASE3/CASE4 are expected to ALREADY PASS at HEAD -- said so explicitly at each
# site below, never silently assumed.
#
# ISOLATION, load-bearing: `ensure_dir_exists`'s bug (case 1c/CASE7) recreates its target tree
# RELATIVE TO THE SUBPROCESS'S OWN CWD. Every `bp-ledger.pl` invocation below is therefore run via
# `bash -c 'cd "$WD" && perl ...'` with an EXPLICIT, fresh, otherwise-empty scratch directory as
# $WD -- never the directory this test file (or the coordinator) happens to be invoked from. Without
# this, a naive test run risks depositing a stray "./C:/..." tree in the real repository, exactly the
# landmine documented in the project CLAUDE.md.
#
# Fixtures are anchored under the native Windows TEMP dir (HostCaps::tempdir_args), never /tmp:
# rotate requires the ledger path be of the exact shape ".../packages/<pkg>.md" or it exits 3 before
# doing anything (reproduced), and every fixture built here has that shape plus a sibling reports/.
# Nothing here ever opens a real blueprint's ledger for writing.
