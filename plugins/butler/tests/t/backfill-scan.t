# platform: windows
# Oracle for blueprint package 02-backfill-scan (blueprint test-platform-split).
# Derived ONLY from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/test-platform-split/specs/02-backfill-scan-spec.md
# (section 4's AC-1..AC-12, section 5's 19-row worked oracle table, section 6's
# edge cases). NOT derived from any implementation: scripts/backfill-test-
# platform.pl does not exist on disk at the time this file is written, and this
# file must never create it -- that is the implementer's job, under a review
# the driver performs separately. This file also never touches any real
# plugins/*/tests/t/*.t file: every scan/classify/apply exercised below runs
# against disposable File::Temp fixtures, except the two places the spec itself
# demands a real-tree read (AC-3's default-glob count, and the standing
# durability assertion for done-criterion 4) -- both of those are --dry-run
# reads only, or (for the standing assertion) a pure TestPlatform::parse_marker
# sweep with no subprocess and no write at all.
#
# WRITTEN BLIND, AND DELIBERATELY WITHOUT A BAIL_OUT ON THE MISSING SCRIPT.
# Every tool invocation below goes through run_tool(), a plain subprocess
# spawn (perl "$IMPL" @args, output captured via redirected temp files, never
# by reopening this process's own STDOUT/STDERR onto an in-memory scalar).
# A missing scripts/backfill-test-platform.pl therefore fails the SPAWN, not
# this test file: perl itself prints "Can't open perl script ..." to STDERR
# and exits 2, and every assertion below simply compares its own expectation
# against that (wrong) observed behaviour and fails normally, with the rest of
# the file continuing to run and report its own count. One coincidence is
# worth flagging up front rather than let it look like a false pass: perl's
# OWN "script not found" exit code (2) happens to equal this tool's PINNED
# usage-error exit code, so the two usage-error checks below (neither flag /
# both flags given) pass on their exit-code assertion alone even before the
# tool exists. Each of those blocks carries a second assertion (STDOUT stays
# empty) that is not subject to the same coincidence, but neither the
# exit-code check nor the STDOUT check would, by itself, prove the tool is
# actually implemented -- see the report for how this was verified instead
# (every other assertion in this file, all mutation/classification/idempotence
# checks, unambiguously traces to the missing script or the not-yet-applied
# backfill).
#
# AC -> block mapping (spec section 4):
#   AC-1  -> PART 5's SIGNAL FIXTURES sub-block (9 signals x positive fixture,
#            each asserted for windows classification + exact signal name)
#   AC-2  -> PART 1 (source-level single-table check + its own counter-fixture)
#   AC-3  -> PART 3 (default GLOB against the real repo tree)
#   AC-4  -> PART 5's "footer sums" assertions, on both the 29-fixture dir and
#            (via PART 3) the real tree
#   AC-5  -> PART 5's dry-run zero-byte-write hash comparison
#   AC-6  -> PART 6 (four headers always printed, pinned line shapes, sort
#            order) plus PART 5's per-file/per-signal line-shape checks
#   AC-7  -> PART 5's post-apply-#1 TestPlatform sweep (every originally-absent
#            fixture now parses legal)
#   AC-8  -> PART 5's apply-#2 block (idempotence: hash-unchanged, zero
#            second-round windows/any, and TestPlatform's own `raw` array
#            length used to rule out a stacked duplicate marker)
#   AC-9  -> PART 5 (row18, the needs-review fixture, checked untouched after
#            both applies)
#   AC-10 -> PART 5's INSERTION-MECHANICS rows (shebang / no-shebang / CRLF /
#            non-ASCII / empty), each verified by exact expected-byte equality
#   AC-11 -> PART 8 (perl -c) -- the second half ("this file itself exits 0
#            with zero not-ok") is validated by re-running this file after
#            implementation, not asserted here (it cannot assert its own
#            future exit code)
#   AC-12 -> PART 4, the standing tree assertion -- MUST fail today (zero
#            files carry a marker yet) and is expected to go green only after
#            the real one-time --apply lands on the live tree
#
# MANDATORY VACUITY GATE (this blueprint's own standing rule):
#   - Every one of the nine @SIGNALS entries gets BOTH a positive fixture
#     (PART 5, SIGNAL FIXTURES) and a negative counter-fixture (immediately
#     alongside it) proving the detector does not fire on prose that merely
#     resembles the trigger text.
#   - AC-2's "no literal leaks outside the table" detector is proven non-
#     vacuous against a fabricated source string engineered to leak, entirely
#     independent of whether the real (currently absent) implementation exists.
#   - Every sweep over a collection (the 29-fixture dir, the real tree) also
#     asserts the collection is non-empty, with a floor well below every
#     historically measured real-tree count so it cannot be satisfied by an
#     accidentally-empty glob.

# PART 9 (fix-batch C, "the --apply write-failure path is untested") --
# forces write_atomic()'s tempfile()/rename() to fail for real, via a genuine
# Windows ACL deny (icacls) on the fixture directory's write/append-data
# rights for the current user. The DOS read-only attribute (chmod 444) does
# NOT force this path -- verified empirically: rename() silently succeeds
# over a read-only destination file on this host (that gap is fix-batch A3,
# covered separately below) -- an ACL deny on the DIRECTORY is what actually
# blocks tempfile() creation, which is the real failure this exercises.
# Windows-only (icacls does not exist elsewhere); skipped on any other $^O.
# =============================================================================
# No fixed plan is declared in this file (done_testing() at EOF), so a
# not-applicable environment is handled with a plain conditional rather than
# Test::More's SKIP: idiom (which exists to preserve a pre-declared count) --
# either branch below still contributes real, counted assertions.
