# t/110 -- regression tests for the a03-ledger-budget-irreducible
# step-6 fix-batch (reviewer-step6.md MAJOR + red-team-step6.md MAJOR-1/MAJOR-2). Derived from
# the pipeline-step-7 dispatch, not the original spec (those cases are already pinned by the
# IMMUTABLE t/ledger-budget-irreducible.t, which this file does not touch or duplicate).
#
# Three findings, three groups of cases below:
#
#   DR  (red-team MAJOR-2): ensure_dir_exists('C:foo/bar') -- a drive-RELATIVE Windows path (a
#       colon with NO separator right after it) -- must be REFUSED, not silently treated as a
#       plain relative path segment. Demonstrated by the red-team to create a stray "C:foo"
#       directory relative to the process CWD. Exercised as a direct in-process unit call
#       (require'd, same technique the red-team used) -- never through a live rotate/--ledger
#       invocation with a drive-relative path, for the same reason the red-team gave: Windows
#       drive-relative resolution depends on per-drive "current directory" process state that is
#       not safely controllable from a test harness, and a wrong guess risks writing onto the
#       real C: drive.
#
#   LK  (reviewer MAJOR / red-team MINOR-2, same defect, consolidated): run_op's real-write
#       success path must call $post_cb BEFORE releasing the ledger's flock, matching the no-op
#       path and op_rotate's $finalize_budget_state. Pinned as a SOURCE-INVARIANT (the ordering
#       of two literal call sites in run_op's real-write branch) -- a true concurrent-process race
#       is not deterministically reproducible in a portable sequential test harness (the reviewer
#       said so explicitly), so the regression test asserts the code shape that makes the race
#       impossible, not the race's absence under load.
#
#   MK  (red-team MAJOR-1): the cross-process suppression marker (<ledger>.budget-state) must not
#       be trusted forever/unconditionally. A forged marker (planted directly, bypassing rotate
#       entirely -- the red-team's exact demonstrated attack) or one whose "notified" claim has
#       aged past its trust window must fail toward RE-NOTIFYING (noisy), never toward permanent
#       silence.
#
# ISOLATION: same discipline as t/109 -- every bp-ledger.pl invocation runs via
# `bash -c 'cd "$WD" && perl ...'` under an explicit, fresh, otherwise-empty scratch directory,
# and DR's direct ensure_dir_exists() call runs after an explicit chdir into its own fresh,
# otherwise-empty scratch directory, verified empty again afterward. Fixtures are anchored under
# the ccpraxis scratch root (HostCaps::tempdir_args), never /tmp, and every ledger path used has
# the required ".../packages/<pkg>.md" shape with a sibling reports/.
