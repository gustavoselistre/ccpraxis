# 141 -- oracle for the REGISTRATION-ROUTE
# half of g02's fix (spec §2.1/§2.2/§2.3/§2.4, AC3/AC4/AC7, done criteria
# 3/4/6). Complements 140 (which pins the SCRIPTS' cwd/env independence,
# already true today). This file pins the thing that is NOT yet true: that
# gate-headless-background.sh and guard-judge-checks.sh are registered via
# ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} (hooks.json, machine-wide, reaches any project once
# promoted -- scout-step1.md item 1) and are registered NOWHERE in
# .claude/settings.json ($CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR-relative, ccpraxis-only, dead
# everywhere else). BEFORE this package's edit, block B below fails (the
# entries are absent from hooks.json) and block C below fails (the entries
# are still present in settings.json) -- that is the correct, expected shape
# of red for a test written from the spec before the fix exists.
#
# NON-VACUITY NOTE, since this is a JSON-structure file and structural
# checks are exactly the kind of oracle this package exists to distrust.
# What makes THESE structural checks different from t/61's and t/112's
# registration-only checks (which this package's whole point is that they
# proved nothing about reach): this file does not stand alone as evidence of
# reach -- 140 supplies the "the script itself doesn't care where it's
# invoked from" half, and scout-step1.md's item 1 (${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
# resolves machine-wide, independent of driven project, confirmed against
# DAME's own settings.local.json) supplies the "the route itself reaches
# other projects" half at the mechanism level. This file's job is narrower
# and more honest: prove the SOURCE FILES were actually edited as the spec
# demands, not that the edit causes a session to fire (spec §6: that would
# require launching a real session, out of reach for this suite).
#
# NEVER MUTATES the real files -- read-only assertions, same discipline as
# h01-settings-registration.t and plugins/sandbox/tests/t/settings-scope-split.t.
