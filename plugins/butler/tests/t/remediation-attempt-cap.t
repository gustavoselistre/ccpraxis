#
# Derived ONLY from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/butler-and-dashboard-overhaul/specs/r01-spec.md
# (sections 0-6) plus the confirmed root cause in
# reports/r01/scout-step1.md. WRITTEN BLIND TO THE FIX.
#
# TWO STRUCTURALLY INDEPENDENT DEFECTS ARE PINNED SEPARATELY, ON PURPOSE, SO A
# PARTIAL FIX SHOWS AS PARTIAL:
#
#   DEFECT 1 (§2.1, Fix A's %att half) — _load_state builds %att only from
#   `keys %$dag` (blueprint.md's table). remediation_merge adds a remediation-
#   queue package into %meta/%status strictly AFTER that read, and never
#   touches %att. So a remediation package's attempt count is undef forever,
#   effective_attempts clamps it to 0, and BP_ATTEMPT_CAP never trips.
#   Blocks A and B below pin this half, via the watchdog_relaunch/watchdog_block
#   JSONL record's `attempts` field carrying an EXACT, registry-seeded integer
#   — never merely "defined", because effective_attempts(undef,...) already
#   returns 0 today, so `ok(defined $attempts)` or `$attempts >= 0` would pass
#   identically before and after the fix (spec §0.3's named vacuity trap).
#
#   DEFECT 2 (§2.1, Fix A's %pid half — found by the architect, NOT the scout)
#   — %pid/%sid have the IDENTICAL ordering bug. A remediation package's pid is
#   undef forever, so pid_alive(undef) always reports dead, and a genuinely
#   alive, progressing coordinator is treated as dead on EVERY watchdog tick.
#   Block C below pins this half independently: it forces the "already
#   launched" gate to be TRUE via the queue entry's pkg_status (decoupled from
#   the attempt/pid backfill under test — see its own comment for why), so the
#   only thing that can make the assertion pass or fail is whether %pid was
#   correctly backfilled.
#
# Also pinned: the min_relaunch interval guard (§2.2, Fix B) — Block D — and
# its DELIBERATE non-persistence across orchestrator restarts (§5) — Block E,
# which exists specifically to catch a future implementer "durability-
# hardening" %last_relaunch_at into the registry, which the spec says would
# silently break t/exit-reason-classification.t's C4 oracle (four SEPARATE
# go() calls at a FIXED $now, simulating four restarts).
#
# THE t/68 C1 LANDMINE (read before touching anything here): t/68's C1 block
# asserts, as CORRECT, that a success-subtype exit on a NON-terminal package
# produces a watchdog_relaunch. Nothing in this file asserts the opposite —
# Block B proves only that a `success` exit_reason does not let a package
# dodge the attempt cap forever, which is a claim about repeated occurrences
# past BP_ATTEMPT_CAP, not about any single success exit being refused.
