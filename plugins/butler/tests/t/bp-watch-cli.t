# 134 — IMMUTABLE ORACLE for w01-bp-watch's CLI surface
# (plugins/butler/scripts/bp-watch.pl, `unless (caller)` block).
#
# Spec: specs/w01-bp-watch-spec.md §2.2 (CLI/exit codes), §3 (behaviors 1-6,
# 9-11, 14), §4 (AC1-3, AC5, AC6, AC9).
#
# EXIT CODES ARE THE SIGNAL (spec §2.2), not bp-watchdog.pl's always-0
# convention — a gate-drive-loop.sh-style consumer needs a cheap $?. Every
# assertion here is paired with BOTH an exit-code check and a content check
# where the behavior claims a narration line, per the dispatch prompt's
# "pair content assertions with exit-code assertions" instruction.
#
# bp-watch.pl DOES NOT EXIST YET. run_watch() below refuses to invoke a
# missing script (returns (undef, '') instead of shelling out to a path perl
# itself would fail to open) specifically so a coincidental exit code from
# perl's own "can't open script" failure (frequently 2) can NEVER be
# misread as a real WORKERS-GONE verdict — that would be a false pass for
# the wrong reason, exactly what NON-VACUITY forbids.

#    USAGE error. The original "no default" rule guarded against

#    apply here, since bp-watch.pl's own poll loop exits the moment the
#    watched condition resolves regardless of the bound. Forcing every
#    caller to size this explicitly produced the opposite failure instead:
