#     exercises orphan_escalations (files a escalations decision for a package
#     ALREADY blocked in its own ledger), which never calls
#     update_registry_pkg at all. _block_and_queue is reached only from the
#     watchdog/resolve-judge attempt-cap paths (:2797/:3195/:3255) or a
#     direct call -- t/escalation-categories.t (an existing, immutable,
#     OUT-OF-WRITE-SET oracle) already calls BpOrch::_block_and_queue
#     directly with a 9/10-positional-arg signature specifically because the
#     production call sites are deep inside multi-hundred-line watchdog
#     blocks. This test follows that SAME precedent (same call shape) rather
#     than inventing a new fixture path, per the spec's "reuse ... helpers
#     rather than inventing new ones" instruction.

#     registry flips to blocked") asserts
#     `is($reg->{packages}{$pkg}{status}, 'blocked', ...)` directly on the
#     OUTCOME of this exact call site. Once bp-orchestrator.pl's :4484
#     `update_registry_pkg($runs, $pkg, { status => 'blocked' })` is deleted
#     per spec §2.1, that key can never be 'blocked' again, and t/115's D3
#     assertion WILL turn red -- t/115 is neither in this package's
#     write_set nor its test_paths, so this test-writer cannot fix it, and
#     the spec does not name t/115 anywhere (unlike its explicit, deliberate
#     callouts for t/answer-decision.t and t/lifecycle-reconcile.t,
#     which it says must stay green UNCHANGED because their producers are
#     untouched -- t/115's producer, by contrast, IS touched by this
#     package). This is a genuine spec gap for the driver, not an oracle
