# t/19 — skill↔director contract test (04-wireup-cleanup, Decision #12).
#
# Asserts that drive-solo/SKILL.md and bp-drive-next.pl carry the same five
# action-name vocabulary. This is the CONJUNCTION guard: assertion group A
# (skill) alone passes if the director drops an action; group B (director) alone
# passes if the skill drops it. Only the conjunction — same @actions list,
# two independent file reads — holds when AND ONLY WHEN both sides carry every
# name. Dropping blueprint-done from either file turns exactly one `like` red.
#
# Not fail-first: both source files (pkg-01, pkg-03) are already written and
# carry all five names. This test is a regression/drift guard, not a red-first
# TDD test. That is expected and correct for an integration/agreement test
# written after both sides exist.
#
# No fixtures, tempdirs, network, clock, powershell, or `require` of the
# director as a module — pure source-text read of two committed files.

# ── Step 2 + 3: Decision #12 five-action contract — both files must carry all ─
# Bare \Q...\E regexes match the token wherever it appears (prose, JSON-shape
# example, table cell, or perl source) — the test asserts AGREEMENT OF
# VOCABULARY, not byte-position, so it survives reformatting of either file
# but breaks the moment a name is dropped or renamed on one side only.
# pause and done are short common words; anchoring them as the action tokens
# by matching the literal name is acceptable because both files use them as
# the action identifier and the purpose is drift-detection, not exhaustive
# parsing (see spec §4 rationale).

}

# ── Step 4: skill references the real director subcommands / verdict source ──
# These four asserts guard against vocabulary drift on the SKILL side only:
# the subcommand names and verdict source are produced by bp-drive-next.pl
# (director) and bp-usage-gate.pl (governor); the skill must name them so a
# user reading the skill knows exactly which scripts carry the mechanics.
