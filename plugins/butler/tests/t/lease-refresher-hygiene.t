# ORACLE for blueprint package 04-refresher-hygiene (host-wake-and-suspend),
# derived ONLY from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/host-wake-and-suspend/specs/04-refresher-hygiene-spec.md
# (22 ACs) plus the ledger's Decision 17 write-set. NOT derived from the
# implementation: at the time this file is written, BpContinuityLease.pm has
# no active_reason/code_snapshot/code_changed/live_script_path/is_live_script/
# lease_log/handover machinery, and bp-keepawake.pl has no stop_helper/
# winpid_of/self_winpid/owner_desc_clean/replace. Every integration assertion
# below is expected to go red for THAT reason -- missing behavior -- not a
# scaffolding bug in this file.
#
# ISOLATION (spec 4, harness requirements). Every process this file spawns
# runs against a TEMP-rooted "live" copy of the scripts under test, never the
# real ~/.claude install and never this session's own continuity refresher or
# keep-awake helper (which hold the real machine's wake-lock and must never be
# touched). CCPRAXIS_LEASE_LIVE_SCRIPT (the spec's test seam) always names a
# path under that copy. Cleanup is keyed ONLY on pids/pidfiles this file
# itself created, in END and SIG INT/TERM handlers, per the three-step order
# the spec's harness section states.
#
# PID NAMESPACES (CLAUDE.md). A refresher this file forks is a perl child in
# OUR msys pid space -- kill()/waitpid() on it directly is correct. A
# keep-awake.ps1 helper (or a throwaway owner) is a NATIVE Windows process
# reachable only by WINPID, read via /proc/<msys-pid>/winpid, verified with
# `tasklist` and killed with `taskkill`, never perl's kill().
