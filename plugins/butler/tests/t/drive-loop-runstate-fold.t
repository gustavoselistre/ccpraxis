# 137 — the w02 FOLD: gate-drive-loop.sh consults
# bp-runstate.pl's effective 'paused' state as an ADDITIONAL escape from
# BLOCK, on top of everything t/drive-loop-gate.t already pins.
#
# Spec: .../specs/w02-dispatch-budget-and-interrupt-spec.md §2.1 (design),
# §3 behaviors 9-12, §4 AC9, §5 (edge cases: unreadable/malformed runstate,
# stale pause via dead pid, stale pause via elapsed deadline).
#
# THIS FILE DOES NOT TOUCH t/drive-loop-gate.t. Section H there
# (:274-322) pins the hard constraint this fold must survive: 'in-flight'
# + nothing scheduled must still BLOCK. That file is read-only ground
# truth here, not duplicated — this file adds a NEW, clearly-labeled
# section ("I") on an otherwise-identical fixture, per spec §2.1's own
# instruction not to add the runstate fixture into H's existing block (so
# "H is untouched" stays independently verifiable by diff).
#
# Fixture helpers below are a DELIBERATE, LIGHT adaptation of t/94's own
# new_project/project_with_package/run_hook — not an import (t/94 has no
# exported library), reproduced here so this file is self-contained and a
# change to t/94's internals cannot silently break this file's fixtures
# without the diff being visible in THIS file's own history.
#
# NON-VACUITY, spelled out per behavior (see also inline comments):
#   - Behavior 9 (H1-shape, no run-state.json at all) currently ALSO passes
#     with NO fold present — it is the "fold is inert against H's fixture"
#     proof, not a red-before-green assertion. It is still load-bearing:
#     the plausible WRONG implementation ("in-flight -> allow, unconditionally")
#     would flip this to rc==0 and fail it.
#   - Behavior 10 (verified live pause) is the ONE assertion that is RED
#     today (current gate-drive-loop.sh never reads bp-runstate.pl at all,
#     so this fixture BLOCKS exactly like H1) and must turn GREEN once the
#     fold lands. This is the "MUST NOW PASS" acceptance case named in the
#     dispatch prompt.
#   - Behaviors 11/12 (stale pause: dead deadline, dead pid) also currently
#     pass VACUOUSLY pre-fold (today's gate blocks everything in-flight,
#     coincidentally including these). They stop being vacuous the moment a
#     fold exists: a fold implemented as a blanket "in-flight -> allow"
#     (the plausible WRONG shape) would flip BOTH to rc==0 and fail them.
#     They are the guard-rail against exactly that wrong implementation,
#     not a currently-red assertion — recorded honestly, not disguised.
