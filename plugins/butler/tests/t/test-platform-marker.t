# Oracle for blueprint package 01-platform-marker (blueprint test-platform-split).
# Derived ONLY from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/test-platform-split/specs/01-platform-marker-spec.md
# (507 lines, AC-1..AC-17 in section 4, the 17-row worked-example oracle in
# section 5). NOT derived from any implementation: plugins/butler/tests/lib/
# TestPlatform.pm does not exist on disk at the time this file is written.
#
# WRITTEN BLIND TO ANY IMPLEMENTATION. Every assertion below is expected to
# fail on ABSENCE OF THE MODULE (a `require` error caught by eval, so a
# fully-qualified call like TestPlatform::parse_marker(...) dies with
# "Undefined subroutine" -- caught per-call, never allowed to abort the run),
# never on a bug, typo, or bad expectation in THIS file.
#
# AC -> test label mapping (every AC-1..AC-17 and every oracle row 1..17 is
# covered by at least one labelled check below; grep this file for the AC/
# oracle number to find its assertions):
#   AC-1  -> oracle#1/2/3 (one per legal value), oracle#7 (dup collapse),
#            oracle#8 (conflict), oracle#12/13 (whitespace variants),
#            oracle#14/15 (malformed), oracle#17/AC-16 (precedence)
#   AC-2  -> oracle#4 (shebang header), oracle#10 (empty string), AC-13 (read_prefix)
#   AC-3  -> "AC-3 (undef input)"
#   AC-4  -> oracle#5 (unrecognised value)
#   AC-5  -> oracle#6 (legal word, wrong case)
#   AC-6  -> the "AC-6" sweep block, near the end
#   AC-7  -> oracle#12 (no whitespace), oracle#13 (leading indentation)
#   AC-8  -> oracle#14 (miscapitalized keyword)
#   AC-9  -> oracle#7 (duplicate identical legal markers)
#   AC-10 -> oracle#8 (legal-vs-legal) + "AC-10b" (legal-vs-illegal)
#   AC-11 -> oracle#9 (beyond the bound) + prefix_bytes()==4096 check
#   AC-12 -> oracle#11 (binary garbage)
#   AC-13 -> the read_prefix() fixture block
#   AC-14 -> the "perl -c" block
#   AC-15 -> oracle#15 (trailing prose)
#   AC-16 -> oracle#17, in its own dedicated precedence block
#   AC-17 -> "AC-17 (two loose-matching lines...)"
#
# MANDATORY VACUITY GATE (this blueprint's own standing rule -- a wrong
# implementation has passed a whole oracle here before, and the defect was in
# the oracle, not the code under test):
#   - Every detector-style check (the AC-6 structural sweep, the
#     malformed-marker-line-is-a-reason-not-an-outcome check, and AC-16's
#     "does not leak into raw" check) is followed by a COUNTER-FIXTURE that
#     proves the same predicate actually fires on data engineered to trip it.
#   - The AC-6 sweep additionally carries a non-vacuity GATE: it demands at
#     least 17 real (non-died) results before trusting "zero violations",
#     so a suite where every call died cannot report a false "pass".
#   - Where something is asserted ABSENT (the malformed line missing from
#     raw; malformed-marker-line never appearing as an outcome), the nearby
#     POSITIVE case (the line's presence when it SHOULD be there) is asserted
#     too, so the absence check cannot pass because everything is empty.
