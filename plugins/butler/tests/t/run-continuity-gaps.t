#   20260819-123218-45c3 -- the Stop gate verifies a pause is WELL-FORMED
#     (watcher pid alive and fingerprinted, deadline in the future) but never
#     that any work is pending. A backgrounded sleep loop armed solely to
#     satisfy the gate passes every check. Observed live: a run idled roughly
#     seven hours before the operator noticed.
#
#   20260819-145104-4651 -- a manually-driven blueprint can complete fully and
#     never be archivable. reconcile reported all_delivered:1 with an EMPTY
#     action list, exited 0, printed nothing, and looked exactly like success.
#
# DONE-CRITERION 4 IS THE CONSTRAINT THAT SHAPES BOTH FIXES: neither may block a
# correct run. Both guards sit on the path every driver takes, and a wrong
# refusal is strictly worse than the gap it closes -- so PART 1 and PART 3 spend
# most of their assertions proving that nothing was made refusable.
