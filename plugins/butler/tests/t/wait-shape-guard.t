# b15-wait-shape-and-pipe-guards oracle. Derived ONLY from
# .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/sandbox-butler-overhaul/specs/b15-wait-shape-and-pipe-guards-spec.md
# §2 (interfaces & contracts), §3 (observable behaviours 1..20), §4 (AC-1..AC-37) and §5 (edge
# cases 1..11), plus the harness contract in the package ledger's 09:36Z entry.

# WRITTEN BLIND TO ANY IMPLEMENTATION. plugins/butler/hooks/wait-shape-guard.sh does not exist at
# the time this file was authored, and hooks.json carries no wait-shape-guard entry. Every AC
# assertion below must therefore fail on MISSING BEHAVIOUR -- `bash "$HOOK"` on an absent file
# exits 127, and `source` of an absent file leaves every bp_ws_* helper undefined so the pure
# callers echo nothing -- never on a perl/harness bug of this file. The assertions labelled
# FIXTURE-SANITY: are deliberate harness self-checks and are expected to PASS even with the hook
# absent; they are the evidence that the red below is attributable to the missing hook and not to
# broken scaffolding.
#
# HARNESS RULES (binding, from the 09:36Z ledger entry and spec §4.1 -- not re-derived here):
#   * %CLEAN_ENV strips EVERY ambient BP_*. This suite is run BY coordinator sessions and harvest
#     judges that export BP_LEDGER/BP_DIR/BP_PROJECT_ROOT; an inherited value silently turns AC-23
#     ("inert outside a butler session") into a FALSE PASS. This is the single most important rule
#     in this file.
#   * run_hook writes the payload to a temp file and runs
#     `timeout N bash "$HOOK" < payload > outfile 2> errfile`. Invoking via `bash` (never by
#     executing the file directly) means a missing exec bit cannot produce a false red. rc 124
#     would mean the hook HUNG -- a real risk for a guard that shells out to grep -- and is asserted
#     against in AC-25 via run_hook_bounded.
#   * done_testing(), NOT a hand-counted `plan tests => N`. t/62's hardcoded plan is described in
#     t/64's own header as "half of the blocker this package already carries".
#   * ALL fixtures are SYNTHESIZED under File::Temp. No live ledger under
#     .ccpraxis-local-data/blueprints/*/packages/ is read, and above all none is written -- those
#     are live orchestration state for a running fleet.
#   * Output is captured to temp files, never by reopening STDOUT/STDERR onto an in-memory scalar
#     (Git-for-Windows perl fails there with "Bad file descriptor"; project CLAUDE.md landmine).
#   * Never shell out to rg: ripgrep is .gitignore-aware and returns a FALSE CLEAN for anything
#     under .ccpraxis-local-data/.
#   * The pure-helper groups run UNCONDITIONALLY (spec §2.1: the file is sourceable by the D1
#     main-guard precisely so matcher correctness has coverage on the jq-less Windows host). Only
#     the subprocess/hook groups are wrapped in one jq-gated SKIP.
#
# NO `use utf8` HERE, DELIBERATELY. The mandated deny messages (§2.10) carry an em dash; it is
# spelled below as the explicit bytes "\xE2\x80\x94" so this file never depends on its own source
# encoding, and every command string stays a byte string -- the bytes a real command carries.
#
# KNOWN-RED, NOT THIS FILE'S BUSINESS (spec §7 E-1): registering the fifth PreToolUse block turns
# exactly one assertion red in t/repeat-guard.t and one in t/ledger-guard.t. Both are outside
# b15's write set and this file deliberately asserts nothing about them.
#
# DELIBERATE OMISSION: AC-37 ("perl t/67 exits 0 with zero not ok") is
# self-referential and untestable from inside this file; the coordinator judges it at step 5. There
# is deliberately no AC-37 block below (t/64 records the same ruling for its own AC-38).

# executable into a new one.
#
# This used to build a shadow bin/ by symlinking every executable on PATH (plus
# /usr/bin, /bin, /usr/local/bin) except $name. Measured on this host that is
# 6401 symlinks, and in t/168 -- which had the identical helper -- it made that
# file the slowest in the repository by a wide margin: 237s, of which ~20s was
# creating them and ~167s was File::Temp's CLEANUP deleting them again at
# process exit. The teardown dominated because File::Path::rmtree is pure Perl
# walking one entry at a time through the MSYS layer; native `rm -rf` does the
# same directory in 1.4s. After this change t/168 runs in 0.6s.
#
# The intent is "a PATH on which $name cannot be found". Removing the
# directories that contain it expresses exactly that, costs one stat per PATH
# entry instead of thousands of symlinks, and creates nothing to clean up.
#
# It is also MORE faithful than the mirror was: the mirror silently dropped
# anything that was not a regular executable file, so the code under test ran
# under a PATH subtly unlike the real one. This keeps the real PATH minus $name.
