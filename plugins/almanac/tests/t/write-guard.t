# t/02 — bug reports are writable only through almanac-bug.pl.
#
# The state machine's freeze is only as good as the ban on editing around it, so
# a PreToolUse hook denies Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit against the reports
# directory — the same shape butler uses to protect blueprint.md.
#
# It is deliberately NOT bp_hook_gate'd. That helper needs BP_LEDGER/BP_DIR/
# BP_PROJECT_ROOT, exported only by bp-launch.sh, so a gated hook is inert in
# exactly the sessions that file bug reports: an ordinary agent in an unrelated
# project. Shipped via this plugin's own hooks.json rather than a host settings
# file, so any project with almanac enabled is covered.
