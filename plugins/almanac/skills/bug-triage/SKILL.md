description: Collect and triage ccpraxis bug reports filed from every project on this machine, and move them through reviewing → taken → resolved/declined. Use when working ON ccpraxis and the user asks what bugs have been reported, wants to review the queue, or says "collect the bug reports", "what's been filed", "triage the bugs". Host-side, ccpraxis-repo work. Skip for filing a new report, which is /almanac:bug-report.

# Triaging ccpraxis bug reports

Agents working in other projects file reports when ccpraxis tooling fails them. They land in each
project's own `.ccpraxis-local-data/bug-reports/`, and every write is indexed machine-wide so you
never have to guess project paths from Claude Code's lossy slugs.

## See the queue

```bash
perl "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/almanac.pl" bug collect
perl "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/almanac.pl" bug collect --status open
perl "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/almanac.pl" bug collect --json
perl "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/almanac.pl" bug verify
```

`collect` (with no filter) walks this project and every project registered for backup; `--status
open` narrows to the untriaged; `--json` is for processing. `verify` reports whether frozen bodies
still match their digests, by re-reading each file from disk rather than trusting the index.

## The states

```
open  ->  reviewing  ->  taken  ->  resolved | declined
             |
             +-------->  open        (hand it back: "not ready, keep editing")
```

```bash
perl "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/almanac.pl" bug set-status <id> --to reviewing
perl "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/almanac.pl" bug set-status <id> --to taken
perl "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/almanac.pl" bug set-status <id> --to resolved --note "fixed in <sha>"
perl "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/almanac.pl" bug set-status <id> --to declined --note "<why>"
```

Leaving `open` **freezes the body** and records its digest. From then on the filer cannot revise it
— deliberately. Send it back to `open` if it genuinely needs more from them.

## Triaging well

**Move it to `reviewing` before you start reading**, not after. The freeze exists so the text cannot
change while you assess it; claiming it afterwards defeats the point.

**Verify the claim from disk before believing it.** Reports are written by agents mid-run, under
pressure, and they are wrong often enough to matter — of the diagnoses filed against one backpack
defect, the filer's and the first replacement were both refuted. Read the `file:line` it names.
Reproduce the evidence. A report can be completely right about the *symptom* and wrong about the
*mechanism*; fix what is actually broken, not what the report guessed.

**`declined` is a real outcome and needs a reason.** Not-a-bug, working-as-intended, or duplicate —
say which, in `--note`. A silently ignored report teaches every future agent that filing is
pointless.

**Duplicates carry information.** The same defect reported twice from different projects is
evidence of blast radius, not noise. Decline the second with a pointer to the first, and let that
raise the first's priority.

## Turning a report into a fix

Fix it here, in the ccpraxis repo — a sandboxed reporter usually *cannot*, because plugin content is
mounted read-only (`EROFS`). That read-only mount is deliberate, so "the reporter should have fixed
it" is not a fair response to any report.

Then, in the same pass:

- **A test, not just a fix.** Prose defects need pinning too — a template that tells a one-shot
  process to wait for a notification is a defect, and it took a test over the template text to stop
  it drifting back.
- **Verify the test is non-vacuous.** Run it against the pre-fix content (`git show HEAD:<path>`)
  and confirm it fails.
- **Remember promotion.** A fix in this clone is inert until merged into `~/.claude/ccpraxis`. The
  reporter's sandbox is serving the *live install*, so until you promote, their next run hits the
  same defect and may re-file it.
- Then `bug set-status <id> --to resolved --note "<sha>"`.

Filing a new report, rather than triaging existing ones, is /almanac:bug-report; see
`plugins/almanac/skills/bug-report/SKILL.md`.
