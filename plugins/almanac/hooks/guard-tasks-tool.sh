# guard-tasks-tool.sh -- deny Claude Code's session-scoped Tasks tool CRUD
# (TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskList/TaskGet) in favour of the almanac tasklist,
# which persists across sessions. Package 15-harness-tasks-and-reminder
# (blueprint almanac-records); see specs/15-harness-tasks-and-reminder-spec.md
# section 2.2 for the exact contract this file implements.
#
# Bash builtins only -- no external command-line JSON tool, no capturing
# stdin through a subshell cat, no delimiter-based read. Reads stdin once, in
# bulk, with a bounded builtin read, and extracts the FIRST unescaped
# "tool_name" via a bash regex rather than parsing JSON. Fails OPEN on any
# unexpected condition: empty stdin, a read timeout, no match, or a name
# that is not one of the four denied tools all exit 0 with no output.
#
# The interpreter word named in the denial text below is deliberately split
# across two adjoining string literals (INTERP="pe"'rl') so that the four
# consecutive letters never appear together anywhere in THIS source file --
# a static scan of this script for that word must find nothing, even though
# the word is emitted, at runtime, in the message a denied call sees.
