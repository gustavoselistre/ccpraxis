# guard-almanac-write.sh — every almanac-owned store is script-owned.
#
# TWO THINGS THIS HOOK PROTECTS, BY PATH SHAPE, NOT BY AN ENUMERATED LIST:
#
#   1. bug reports          <project>/.ccpraxis-local-data/bug-reports/<id>.md
#   2. almanac record stores <project>/.ccpraxis-local-data/almanac/<type>/...
#                             <home>/.claude/claude-code-vault/almanac/<type>/...
#
# Both have a state machine or a compare-and-swap lock that a direct Edit/Write
# would bypass outright, so this denies Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit
# against either shape and points at the script that owns it instead. Bug
# reports freeze once picked up (open -> reviewing -> taken -> resolved |
# declined); stores are protected by Almanac::Lock plus a sealed digest, and
# almanac-bug.pl verify reports either kind of out-of-band write.
#
# NOT bp_hook_gate'd, deliberately. That helper requires BP_LEDGER/BP_DIR/
# BP_PROJECT_ROOT, which only bp-launch.sh exports — so a gated hook is inert
# in exactly the sessions that hit this most: an ordinary agent working in
# some unrelated project. Shipped via this plugin's hooks.json rather than a
# host settings file, so any project with almanac enabled gets it.
#
# Reading is untouched. Fails OPEN on anything unexpected — empty/broken
# input, a payload with no path, a perl that dies at startup — because a
# guard that wedges an unrelated project's session is worse than an
# unguarded edit; the sealed digest (almanac-bug.pl verify) still detects the
# out-of-band write regardless. That layer does not depend on prevention.
#
# COST DISCIPLINE (DC6, budget 50ms median). Every Edit/Write in every
# session pays for this hook, so it is built in two stages: a bash-only
# prefilter that spawns NOTHING (no cat, no perl, no jq) for the overwhelming
# majority of edits that touch neither root, and a single perl process (core
# JSON::PP only) for the rest. harness-facts (g) measured a bash spawn at
# ~30.6ms and one perl parse at a further ~46-47ms — paying the perl cost on
# every call would blow the budget outright, which is why the prefilter must
# complete with no process spawned at all.
#
# FIX-BATCH (post-review 09): the perl->bash field separator is \x1f, not a
# tab -- tab is IFS *whitespace*, so `IFS=$'\t' read` collapsed empty fields
# (every bug denial's TYPE is empty) and shifted every field after it. \x1f
# is never IFS whitespace, so an empty field stays a real, distinct field.
# The classifier is also segment-based now (not one big regex against the
# joined path), so it can: (a) resolve a relative path against the payload's
# own `cwd` before classifying; (b) strip a Windows trailing dot/space from
# any non-`.`/`..` segment, matching what CreateFileW itself does; (c) treat
# an 8.3 short-name segment (`CCPRAX~1`) as equal to the long literal it is
# a legal abbreviation of, using the same basis test
# BpHook::WriteGuards::_seg_eq_base uses (first up-to-6 alphanumerics of the
# long name, folded) -- no filesystem access, so this holds even for a path
# that is never opened.
set -u

# Stage 0: read the payload with a bash BUILTIN — no cat, no $(...), no pipe,
# no external command. -N is the buffered form, required on a non-tty. Any
# read status (timeout, short read, EOF) is tolerated; an empty payload just
# fails open below.

# Stage 1: the prefilter. A case-insensitive bash builtin match for either

# segment can shorten to (S2, post-review 09 -- corrected). `.ccpraxis-local-
# data` -> `CCPRAX~n`, `claude-code-vault` -> `CLAUDE~n` (Windows 8.3 names
# take the first up-to-6 alphanumerics of the long name, then `~`, then a
# digit). A bare `~` was tried first and rejected: ANDR~1 (the shortened
# form of this very host's own username) is itself `~digit`, and it sits in
# the path of every session scratchpad and %TEMP% file, so that trigger
# spawned perl on ordinary, harmless paths and lost the zero-spawn-on-a-miss
# property for a common case. A short name on some OTHER ancestor segment
# (ANDR~1 on the way to a claude-code-vault that is spelled out in full)
# still matches via the plain literal substring above -- only the STORE
# segment's OWN shortening needs its own trigger. None present -> exit 0, no
# process spawned.

A report's body is FROZEN once it leaves 'open' — that is what lets a reviewer read it without the filer rewriting it underneath them, and what makes 'taken' mean something. A direct edit would bypass both the state machine and the sha256 recorded at freeze time.

  While still open, revise it:
    perl <ccpraxis>/plugins/almanac/scripts/almanac-bug.pl update $ID --body -

  Already reviewing/taken? It is deliberately immutable. File a follow-up:
    perl <ccpraxis>/plugins/almanac/scripts/almanac-bug.pl file --title "..." --body -

  Check state:  almanac-bug.pl list        (this project)
