# guard-almanac-write.sh — bug reports may only be written by almanac-bug.pl.
#
# The report state machine (open -> reviewing -> taken -> resolved|declined)
# freezes a report's body once ccpraxis picks it up, so a filer cannot rewrite
# history under a reviewer mid-read. That guarantee is worth nothing if an agent
# can just Edit the file, so this denies Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit
# against the reports directory and points at the verb instead. Same pattern as
# butler's guard-blueprint-write.sh, which protects blueprint.md the same way.
#
# NOT bp_hook_gate'd, deliberately. That helper requires BP_LEDGER/BP_DIR/
# BP_PROJECT_ROOT, which only bp-launch.sh exports — so a gated hook is inert
# in exactly the sessions that file bug reports: an ordinary agent working in
# some unrelated project. Shipped via this plugin's hooks.json rather than a
# host settings file, so any project with almanac enabled gets it.
#
# Reading is untouched. Fails OPEN on anything unexpected: a guard that wedges
# an unrelated project's session is worse than an unguarded edit, and the
# frozen-body sha256 catches an out-of-band write regardless (`almanac-bug.pl
# verify`) — that layer does not depend on prevention.

  $FPATH

A report's body is FROZEN once it leaves 'open' — that is what lets a reviewer read it without the filer rewriting it underneath them, and what makes 'taken' mean something. A direct edit would bypass both the state machine and the sha256 recorded at freeze time.

  While still open, revise it:
    perl <ccpraxis>/plugins/almanac/scripts/almanac-bug.pl update $ID --body -

  Already reviewing/taken? It is deliberately immutable. File a follow-up:
    perl <ccpraxis>/plugins/almanac/scripts/almanac-bug.pl file --title "..." --body -

  Check state:  almanac-bug.pl list        (this project)
                almanac-bug.pl verify      (digests still intact?)
