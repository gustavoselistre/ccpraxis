package Almanac::Store;
# Almanac::Store -- the CRUD + ordering layer every almanac record type (todos,
# notes, tasklists, pending decisions -- packages 04/05/07/08) calls. Built
# over Almanac::Lock (package 01) and Almanac::Record (package 02). Blueprint
# almanac-records, package 03-store (see specs/03-store-spec.md).
#
# THIS MODULE DEFINES METHODS NAMED AFTER PERL BUILTINS -- open(), exists(),
# delete(), read(), list(). Perl resolves a bareword `open(...)`/`exists
# EXPR`/`delete EXPR` to CORE:: regardless of a same-named sub in the same
# package (confirmed empirically: it still works, but emits "Ambiguous call
# resolved as CORE::open()" under `use warnings`). Every BUILTIN call in this
# file is therefore qualified as CORE::open / CORE::exists / CORE::delete so
# there is no ambiguity warning and no doubt about which one runs. Method
# calls ($store->open, $store->exists(...), $store->delete(...)) are always
# unambiguous (arrow syntax is a namespaced method lookup, never a bareword).
#
# WHY STORE OWNS ITS OWN WRITE PATH INSTEAD OF CALLING
# Almanac::Record::write_file (accepted at the step-2 gate, spec S7.3): DC7
# needs a kill point BETWEEN the temp write and the rename, and write_file
# owns that window internally. The condition of that acceptance is a pinned
# equivalence, asserted in almanac-store-crud.t: for the same record shape,
# the bytes this module writes and the bytes Almanac::Record::write_file
# would write are byte-identical -- both ultimately call
# Almanac::Record::serialize() on the same record hash, so this holds by
# construction as long as _write_record here never reimplements serialize().
#
# CORE PERL ONLY (S2.0). No exit(), no alarm(), no unlink of a .lock path
# ever (Almanac::Lock never removes one, on any path -- Lock.pm rule 3 -- and
# this module does not either).

# Almanac::Store::Error -- the blessed die payload (spec S2.5). Same shape as
# Almanac::Record::Error, a separate class so `kind` namespaces never
# collide. exit_code is always 2; the sanctioned exit path for a caller is
# Almanac::Record::fatal($err) (this module adds no fatal() of its own --
# MR/S2.5).
#
# Every message ends with a machine block:
#   almanac-error:
#     kind: <value>
#     <key>: <value>
#     ...
# -- literal "almanac-error:" at column 0, then two-space-indented "key:
# value" lines, kind first, remaining keys in the fixed per-kind order below.
# A value is squashed to one token (any whitespace/control run -> "_"; an
# undef/empty value -> "-"). No test may match the prose line; only the
# block, via m/^\s{2}field:\s(\S+)$/m.

# connection. `overload` is core Perl and S2.5 already mandates it, so the
