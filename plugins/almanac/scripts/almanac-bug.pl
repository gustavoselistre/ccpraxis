# almanac-bug.pl — ccpraxis bug reports filed BY agents working in other projects.
#
# THE PROBLEM. An agent hits a ccpraxis tooling defect while working in some
# unrelated project. Today that observation dies with the session: it is prose
# in a transcript nobody re-reads. There is no path from "the tooling failed me
# here" to "ccpraxis knows about it".
#
# THE SHAPE. One file per report, written ONLY through this script, in a small
# state machine that freezes a report once ccpraxis has picked it up:
#
#   open  ->  reviewing  ->  taken  ->  resolved | declined
#
# `open` is the reporter's: they may keep editing while nobody has looked. From
# `reviewing` onward the content is FROZEN — the filer cannot rewrite history
# under a reviewer who is mid-read, and a `taken` report cannot be quietly
# reworded after the fact.
#
# THREE LAYERS OF IMMUTABILITY, because two are bypassable:
#   1. this script refuses a content change once frozen;
#   2. a PreToolUse hook denies Edit/Write against the reports directory, so the
#      script is the only sanctioned writer (same pattern as
#      guard-blueprint-write.sh);
#   3. a sha256 recorded at freeze time DETECTS an out-of-band edit anyway —
#      `verify` reports it. Layers 1 and 2 can be routed around by a determined
#      Bash call; layer 3 cannot, because it does not rely on preventing the
#      write.
#
# WHERE THINGS LIVE. Reports sit in the project they were filed from, so they
# travel with the context that produced them, and with nothing else:
#   <project>/.ccpraxis-local-data/bug-reports/<id>.md
# There is NO index — see the note above known_projects(). Cross-project
# discovery walks steward's machine-local project registry, the same one
# /steward:backup walks, so a sandboxed filer needs no access to the host.

# THERE IS NO INDEX, and the reason is worth keeping.
#
# The first design wrote an append-only index under the writer's $HOME so
# `collect` could find reports across projects. That is broken for the primary
# filer. A sandboxed agent's $HOME/.claude IS the project's own
# .ccpraxis-local-data/claude-home (bind-mounted to /root/.claude), so its index
# write lands inside that one project and never reaches the host at all — the
# machine-wide index would silently miss exactly the reports it exists to
# collect. It also wrote into ~/.claude/ccpraxis, the live install's git tree,
# which blocked a promotion pull.
#
# The report FILE in the project is the only durable state, and steward already
# solves discovery: ~/.claude/claude-code-vault/.registry-local.json maps slug ->
# absolute project path on this machine, and is deliberately gitignored inside
# the vault because those paths are machine-local. That registry is what

# FIX (defect 2, 20260911-225720-4c57): the file is read via `<:raw>` (raw,

# JSON::PP the input is UTF-8-encoded bytes rather than already-decoded
# characters. Without it, a registry path containing a real multi-byte
# character (job-search: "/c/Users/André/Personal Files/Job search")
# decodes to MOJIBAKE: the two raw bytes of 'é' (0xC3 0xA9) each become their
# own bogus codepoint (U+00C3, U+00A9) instead of collapsing to one (U+00E9).
# opendir() on that corrupted string then fails, silently, and a project's

# FIX (defect 1, 20260911-225720-4c57): the caller's own root arrives as
# `C:/Development/ccpraxis` (from $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR / Cwd::abs_path), while
# the steward registry stores the POSIX spelling `/c/Development/ccpraxis`.
# `all_report_paths` used to dedupe on the RAW string, so both spellings
# survived into @roots, both got walked, and every report under that one
# directory was yielded twice -- measured: 88 reports where the project held
# 43 (43*2 + 2 from another project).
#
# Cwd::abs_path is the real answer whenever the directory exists: it
# resolves case, "..", backslashes and symlinks to one canonical form, which
# is exactly why both `C:/Development/ccpraxis` and `/c/Development/ccpraxis`
# collapse to `/c/Development/ccpraxis` on this host (verified). It returns
# undef for a path that does not currently resolve -- a registered project
# whose directory has moved or been deleted -- so this falls back to a
# lightweight textual normalisation for exactly that case (backslashes to
# forward slashes, `/x/` <-> `X:/` drive form, uppercased drive letter, no
# trailing slash). The fallback cannot resolve symlinks or on-disk case, but
# a root that fails even abs_path is already unreadable to list_reports_in,
# so it contributes nothing either way -- this only stops it being walked
# under BOTH of its spellings.

# cas_write(): FIX 1 (fixbatch-step7, red-team HIGH) — a load-modify-write
# race defeated the freeze guarantee. Both `update` and `set-status` LOAD a
# report, then do work that can take real wall-clock time (`update`'s
# `--body -` BLOCKS on stdin), then WRITE `%f` built from that stale load.
# If a `set-status --to reviewing` landed in that window, `update`'s
# subsequent write reverted the status to `open` and erased
# content_sha256/frozen_at entirely — silently undoing the freeze the
# refusal message two lines above it promises. `verify` would then say "not
# frozen" rather than TAMPERED, so nothing would even report the problem.
#
# THIS IS LAYER TWO, AND THE COMMENT THAT USED TO BE HERE WAS WRONG.
#
# It claimed there was no portable OS-level lock worth reaching for on this
# platform, and built the whole design on that claim. The claim was false.
# bp-blueprint.pl:425 has taken flock(LOCK_EX) on a sidecar lock file for
# every blueprint mutation in this repo since it was written, and a direct
# measurement on 2026-09-11 — two concurrent processes, one sidecar lock
# file, both host perls — showed the waiter blocking for the holder's full
# remaining hold and then acquiring. flock works here.
#
# So the three read-modify-write verbs now take a real exclusive lock across
# the WHOLE load-modify-write (Almanac::Lock, on `<report>.md.lock`), and two
# concurrent writers QUEUE rather than collide. A refusal is not
# serialization: the requirement is that two agents editing one record both
# get their change, in some order, not that one of them is told to retry.
#
# cas_write is not deleted and not weakened — it is DEMOTED. Three layers,
# each catching what the one above it cannot:
#
#   1. the lock            — two sanctioned writers racing
#   2. this byte CAS       — a writer that BYPASSED the lock entirely
#   3. content_sha256      — an out-of-band write that routed around 1 and 2
#
# LAYER TWO is therefore about a writer that took no lock at all: it re-reads
# the file's actual on-disk BYTES immediately before the write and compares
# them to the bytes `load()` captured. It refuses instead of ever writing, so
# an unsanctioned concurrent write becomes a loud, specific refusal rather
# than silent data loss. It takes no lock and releases none — its caller
# holds one.

# has_forbidden_bytes(): the ONE definition of "not safe in a frontmatter
# value", shared by the CLI-boundary guard (_reject_multiline, in package
# main) and the _render structural backstop below, so the two layers enforce
# literally the same rule instead of two independently-maintained
# approximations of it.
#
# Originally this was "\r or \n" -- exactly the two bytes report ee3c's
# reproduction used. A red-team probe (fixbatch-step7, 2026-08-19) showed
# --area containing U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR sailed through unrejected and
# landed verbatim in the rendered frontmatter; any consumer that treats
# U+2028 as a line break (this script's own _parse does not; some other
# reader might) sees an injected field. The class was never "CR/LF", it was
# "any line or paragraph break, and any control character" -- so that is
# what is enforced now:
#   - every C0 control character except TAB (\x00-\x08, \x0A-\x1F)
#   - DEL (\x7F)
#   - every C1 control character (\x80-\x9F), which includes NEL (U+0085)
#   - the two Unicode line/paragraph separators, U+2028 and U+2029
# TAB is deliberately still allowed: it does not break line-oriented parsing
# (_parse splits on /\r?\n/ only) and is common in pasted text.
#
# Verified on this platform (Git-for-Windows/Windows perl): argv arrives as
# raw, UN-decoded bytes, and codepoints <= 0xFF and > 0xFF do not even take
# the SAME encoding form consistently -- U+2028 (a Perl \x{...} escape whose
# value is > 0xFF) showed up as the three-byte UTF-8 sequence \xE2\x80\xA8,
# but U+0085 NEL (a \x{...} escape whose value is <= 0xFF, so Perl does not
# force the string to internal UTF-8) showed up as the single raw byte
# \x85, NOT its two-byte UTF-8 encoding \xC2\x85. Both forms had to be
# handled empirically, not assumed. Rather than chase every encoding a
# caller might produce, the C1 range (\x80-\x9F) is matched as STANDALONE
# bytes, which subsumes both "\x85 alone" and "\xC2\x85" (its second byte
# already falls in \x80-\x9F). The accepted cost: a value containing
# genuine multi-byte UTF-8 text whose CONTINUATION byte happens to land in
# \x80-\x9F (e.g. some accented Latin Extended-A characters) would also be
# rejected. That is judged safe/acceptable here -- report `area`/`title`/
# `note` values are short, ASCII-oriented labels in practice, and a false
# rejection fails LOUD (the CLI refuses with a message) rather than
# silently corrupting anything, which is the failure mode this whole fix
# exists to close.

# PACKAGE 09 (report 20260917-040452-f500): the original new_id keyed only on
# the clock to the second plus $$ & 0xffff -- 10,000 generations inside one
# process-second yielded ONE distinct id, not "occasionally collides". That
# never bit hand-paced bug filing, but package 09 writes records
# programmatically, which removes the pacing that hid it.
#
# ID_BASE is minted once (mixing pid and a random draw, so two concurrent
# processes still diverge) and ID_SEQ increments on every call, so up to
# 65,536 ids within one process in one second are distinct. The SHAPE is
# unchanged (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<4 hex>) -- 61 live reports, commit messages and
# cross-report citations already depend on it, and new ids are additive: an
# existing legacy id is never rewritten or reparsed by this function.
#
# TWO GENERATORS, DELIBERATELY (ledger item 3, parity decision). Almanac::Record
# has its own new_id with an 8-hex tail (pid4hex + seq4hex) -- a different
# shape. They are NOT unified: bug ids stay 4-hex because
# plugins/butler/tests/t/tooling-bug-filing.t:457 pins
# ^\d{8}-\d{6}-[0-9a-f]{4}$ for a report filed through almanac-bug.pl, and
# nothing reads a bug id and a store id through one shared grammar -- verify
# treats both as opaque file names, and bug reports and store records never
# share a directory. Kept as two generators, not merged into one.

almanac-bug.pl — ccpraxis bug reports, one file per report.

  file --title T (--body - | --body-file F) [--severity S] [--area A] [--project ROOT]
        Create a report in the current project. Prints its path.
  append <id> (--body - | --body-file F)
        Add to the end of a report's body. Allowed ONLY while status is `open`. Use this to record progress — it cannot lose what is already there.
  update <id> (--body - | --body-file F) [--title T] [--severity S] [--replace]
        REPLACE a report's body. Allowed ONLY while status is `open`. Refuses when the existing body would be discarded unless --replace is given; there is no undo, as reports are gitignored.
  set-status <id> --to <state> [--note N] [--repair]
        open -> reviewing -> taken -> resolved|declined  (reviewing -> open to hand back)
        --repair: ONLY for a report whose current status is not a known state (hand-written, or from before this machine existed). It cannot skip a legal transition between valid states. Put it last on the line.
        Leaving `open` FREEZES the body and records its sha256.
  list [--status S] [--json]        reports in THIS PROJECT only
  collect [--status S] [--json]     reports across every project REGISTERED in steward's backup registry -- filing a bug and registering for backup are unrelated decisions, so an unregistered project is excluded, not scanned for
  verify                            re-check every frozen body against its digest

One report per file. Write only through this script — a PreToolUse hook denies direct edits to the reports directory.
